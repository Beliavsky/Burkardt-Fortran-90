    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGLE_DUNAVANT_RULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines the weights and abscisass for 20 quadrature rules 
      over the interior of a triangle in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      These rules are almost optimal, in the sense that, for each polynomial
      degree, the number of points used in the rule is close to, or equal to,
      the theoretical minimum possible value.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few of the rules include one or two points which are "slightly"
      outside the triangle;  a few of the rules include weights which
      are negative.  Both of these occurrences are generally undesirable.
