      FD1D_WAVE <br> 
      Finite Difference Method<br> 
      1D Wave Equation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_WAVE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      applies the finite difference method to solve
      a version of the wave equation in one spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wave equation considered here is an extremely simplified model
      of the physics of waves.  Many facts about waves are not modeled by this
      simple system, including that wave motion in water can depend 
      on the depth of the medium, that waves tend to disperse, and that waves
      of different frequency may travel at different speeds.  However, as
      a first model of wave motion, the equation is useful because it captures 
      a most interesting feature of waves, that is, their usefulness in 
      transmitting signals.  
    </p>

    <p>
      This code solves the 1D wave equation of the form:
      <pre>
        Utt = c^2 Uxx
      </pre>
      over the spatial interval [X1,X2] and time interval [T1,T2],
      with initial conditions:
      <pre>
        U(T1,X)  = U_T1(X),
        Ut(T1,X) = UT_T1(X),
      </pre>
      and boundary conditions of Dirichlet type:
      <pre>
        U(T,X1) = U_X1(T),<br>
        U(T,X2) = U_X2(T).
      </pre>
      The value <b>C</b> represents the propagation speed of waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code uses the finite difference method, and marches
      forward in time, solving for all the values of U at the next
      time step by using the values known at the previous two time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Central differences may be used to approximate both the time
      and space derivatives in the original differential equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, assuming we have available the approximated values of U
      at the current and previous times, we may write a discretized
      version of the wave equation as follows:
      <pre>
        Uxx(T,X) = ( U(T,   X+dX) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T,   X-dX) ) / dX^2
        Utt(T,X) = ( U(T+dt,X   ) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T-dt,X   ) ) / dT^2
      </pre>
      If we multiply the first term by C^2 and solve for the single
      unknown value U(T+dt,X), we have:
      <pre>
        U(T+dT,X) =        (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
                    +  2 * ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
                    +      (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
                    -                                  U(T-dT,X   )
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT, except for FIRST step!)
    </p>

    <p>
      However, on the very first step, we only have the values of U
      for the initial time, but not for the previous time step.
      In that case, we use the initial condition information for dUdT
      which can be approximated by a central difference that involves
      U(T+dT,X) and U(T-dT,X):
      <pre>
        dU/dT(T,X) = ( U(T+dT,X) - U(T-dT,X) ) / ( 2 * dT )
      </pre>
      and so we can estimate U(T-dT,X) as
      <pre>
        U(T-dT,X) = U(T+dT,X) - 2 * dT * dU/dT(T,X)
      </pre>
      If we replace the "missing" value of U(T-dT,X) by the known values
      on the right hand side, we now have U(T+dT,X) on both sides of the
      equation, so we have to rearrange to get the formula we use
      for just the first time step:
      <pre>
        U(T+dT,X) =   1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
                    +       ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
                    + 1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
                    +  dT *                         dU/dT(T,   X   )
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT for FIRST step.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear now that the quantity ALPHA = C * DT / DX will affect
      the stability of the calculation.  If it is greater than 1, then
      the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 is negative, and the
      sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients becomes unbounded.
