subroutine fd1d_wave_alpha ( x_num, x1, x2, t_num, t1, t2, c, alpha )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! FD1D_WAVE_ALPHA computes ALPHA for the 1D wave equation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The explicit timestepping procedure uses the quantity ALPHA, which
!    is determined by this function.
!
!    If the spatial region bounds are X1 <= X <= X2, containing X_NUM equally
!    spaced nodes, including the endpoints, and the time domain similarly
!    extends from T1 <= T <= T2 containing T_NUM equally spaced time values,
!    then
!
!      ALPHA = C * DT / DX
!            = C * ( ( T2 - T1 ) / ( T_NUM - 1 ) )
!                / ( ( X2 - X1 ) / ( X_NUM - 1 ) ).
!
!    For a stable computation, it must be the case that ALPHA < 1.
!
!    If ALPHA is greater than 1, then the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 
!    is negative, and the sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients 
!    becomes unbounded.  In such a case, the user must reduce the time step 
!    size appropriately.

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! FD1D_WAVE_START takes the first step for the wave equation.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This program solves the 1D wave equation of the form:
!
!      Utt = c^2 Uxx
!
!    over the spatial interval [X1,X2] and time interval [T1,T2],
!    with initial conditions:
!
!      U(T1,X)  = U_T1(X),
!      Ut(T1,X) = UT_T1(X),
!
!    and boundary conditions of Dirichlet type:
!
!      U(T,X1) = U_X1(T),
!      U(T,X2) = U_X2(T).
!
!    The value C represents the propagation speed of waves.
!
!    The program uses the finite difference method, and marches
!    forward in time, solving for all the values of U at the next
!    time step by using the values known at the previous two time steps.
!
!    Central differences may be used to approximate both the time
!    and space derivatives in the original differential equation.
!
!    Thus, assuming we have available the approximated values of U
!    at the current and previous times, we may write a discretized
!    version of the wave equation as follows:
!
!      Uxx(T,X) = ( U(T,   X+dX) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T,   X-dX) ) / dX^2
!      Utt(T,X) = ( U(T+dt,X   ) - 2 U(T,X) + U(T-dt,X   ) ) / dT^2
!
!    If we multiply the first term by C^2 and solve for the single
!    unknown value U(T+dt,X), we have:
!
!      U(T+dT,X) =        (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
!                  +  2 * ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
!                  +      (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
!                  -                                  U(T-dT,X   )
!
!    (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT, except for FIRST step!)
!
!    However, on the very first step, we only have the values of U
!    for the initial time, but not for the previous time step.
!    In that case, we use the initial condition information for dUdT
!    which can be approximated by a central difference that involves
!    U(T+dT,X) and U(T-dT,X):
!
!      dU/dT(T,X) = ( U(T+dT,X) - U(T-dT,X) ) / ( 2 * dT )
!
!    and so we can estimate U(T-dT,X) as
!
!      U(T-dT,X) = U(T+dT,X) - 2 * dT * dU/dT(T,X)
!
!    If we replace the "missing" value of U(T-dT,X) by the known values
!    on the right hand side, we now have U(T+dT,X) on both sides of the
!    equation, so we have to rearrange to get the formula we use
!    for just the first time step:
!
!      U(T+dT,X) =   1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X+dX)
!                  +       ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X   )
!                  + 1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(T,   X-dX)
!                  +  dT *                         dU/dT(T,   X   )
!
!    (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT for FIRST step.)
!
!    It should be clear now that the quantity ALPHA = C * DT / DX will affect
!    the stability of the calculation.  If it is greater than 1, then
!    the middle coefficient 1-C^2 DT^2 / DX^2 is negative, and the
!    sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients becomes unbounded.
