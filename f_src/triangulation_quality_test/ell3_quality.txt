  C++ version:
  Compute triangulation quality measures.

  Read the header of "ell3_nodes.txt".

  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM = 2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  = 22

  Read the data in "ell3_nodes.txt".

  First 5 nodes:

  Row:       1             2       
  Col
    1              0             0

  Triangle order TRIANGLE_ORDER = 3
  Number of triangles TRIANGLE_NUM  = 24

  Read the data in "ell3_triangles.txt".

  First 5 triangles:

  Row:      1       2       3  
  Col

    1       1       2       6  
    2       7       6       2

    5       3       4       8  

  ALPHA compares the smallest angle against 60 degrees.
  Values of ALPHA range from 0 (extremely poor) to 1 (excellent).

  ALPHA_MIN = minimum over all triangles = 0.75
  ALPHA_AVE = average over all triangles = 0.75
  ALPHA_AREA = average weighted by area =  0.75

  AREA compares the areas of the triangles.
  Values of AREA_RATIO range from 0 (extremely poor) to 1 (excellent).

  AREA_MIN   = minimum area         = 0.5
  AREA_MAX   = maximum area         = 0.5
  AREA_RATIO = minimum/maximum area = 1
  AREA_AVE   = average area         = 0.5
  AREA_STD   = standard deviation   = 0

  Q is the ratio of 2 * inradius to outradius.
  Values of Q range from 0 (extremely poor) to 1 (excellent).

  Q_MIN  = minimum Q                  = 0.828427
  Q_MAX  = maximum Q                  = 0.828427
  Q_AVE  = average Q                  = 0.828427
  Q_AREA = average Q weighted by area = 0.828427

  The geometric bandwidth          M = 11
