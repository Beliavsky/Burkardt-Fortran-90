SPHERE_DELAUNAY
  FORTRAN90 version
  Given a set of XYZ points on the sphere,
  compute the Delaunay triangulation.
 
XYZ_READ:
  Read      100 text lines from gen_00100.xyz
  Read      100 sets of (X,Y,Z) coordinates.
 
TRPLOT created the triangulation plot file: "gen_00100.eps".
 
TR_TO_XYZL:
  Wrote the Delaunay XYZL file "gen_00100.xyzl".
