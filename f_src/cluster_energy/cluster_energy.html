      CLUSTER_ENERGY <br> Clusterings with Minimal Energy
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CLUSTER_ENERGY</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      seeks to organize data into a given number of clusters,
      in a way which minimizes the cluster energy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, suppose we are given a set of
      data points in NUM_DIM dimensional space.  Suppose we are told to use
      C_NUM clusters.  Each cluster is to be represented by a CENTER
      point.  Each data point is to be assigned to a cluster.  The
      total energy is the sum of the cluster energies, and the energy
      of a cluster is the sum of the squares of the distance of each
      data point to its center point.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code allows the user to specify a dimension, the number of
      data points, the range of the data, a range of cluster values to
      try, and the number of cluster iterations to carry out.  It then
      tries to compute the minimal cluster energy for the given data,
      and the various numbers of clusters.
