      PYRAMID_EXACTNESS <br> Precision Test for Pyramid Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PYRAMID_EXACTNESS</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      measures the precision of a quadrature rule
      over the interior of the unit pyramid in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integration region is:
      <pre>
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= X <= 1 - Z
       - ( 1 - Z ) <= Y <= 1 - Z
                 0 <= Z <= 1.
      </pre>
      When Z is zero, the integration region is a square lying in the (X,Y)
      plane, centered at (0,0,0) with "radius" 1.  As Z increases to 1, the
      radius of the square diminishes, and when Z reaches 1, the square has
      contracted to the single point (0,0,1).
