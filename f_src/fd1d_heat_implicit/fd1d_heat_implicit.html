      FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT <br> 
      Finite Difference Solution of the<br> 
      Time Dependent 1D Heat Equation<br>
      using Implicit Time Stepping
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD1D_HEAT_IMPLICIT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      solves the time-dependent 1D heat equation, using the finite difference
      method in space, and an implicit version of the method of lines to handle
      integration in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code solves
      <pre>
        dUdT - k * d2UdX2 = F(X,T)
      </pre>
      over the interval [A,B] with boundary conditions
      <pre>
        U(A,T) = UA(T),
        U(B,T) = UB(T),
      </pre>
      over the time interval [T0,T1] with initial conditions
      <pre>
        U(X,T0) = U0(X)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A second order finite difference is used to approximate the
      second derivative in space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solver applies an
      implicit backward Euler approximation to the first derivative in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resulting finite difference form can be written as
      <pre>
       U(X,T+dt) - U(X,T)                     ( U(X-dx,+dtT) - 2 U(X,+dtT) + U(X+dx,+dtT) )
       ------------------  = F(X,T+dt) + k *  ---------------------------------------------
                dt                                   dx * dx
      </pre>
      or, assuming we have solved for all values of U at time T, we have
      <pre>
            -     k * dt / dx / dx   * U(X-dt,T+dt)
      + ( 1 + 2 * k * dt / dx / dx ) * U(X,   T+dt)
            -     k * dt / dx / dx   * U(X+dt,T+dt)
      =               dt             * F(X,   T+dt)
      +                                U(X,   T)
      </pre>
      which can be written as A*x=b, where A is a tridiagonal matrix whose
      entries are the same for every time step.
