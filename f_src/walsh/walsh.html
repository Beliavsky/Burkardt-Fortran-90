    <p>
      <b>WALSH</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements versions of the Walsh and Haar transforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the programs, as printed in the reference, had a few typographical
      errors.  Several programs, in particular FHT and FRT, could not be made to
      perform as described in the text, and hence have been omitted.
