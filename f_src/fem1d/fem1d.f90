!
!! MAIN is the main program for FEM1D.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    FEM1D solves a one dimensional ODE using the finite element method.
!
!    The differential equation solved is
!
!      - d/dX (P dU/dX) + Q U  =  F
!
!    The finite-element method uses piecewise linear basis functions.
!
!    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
!    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
!
!    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
!
!
!    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with NSUB+1 points,
!
!    XN(0) = XL, XN(1)=XL+H, XN(2)=XL+2*H, ..., XN(NSUB)=XR.
!
!    This creates NSUB subintervals, with interval number 1
!    having endpoints XN(0) and XN(1), and so on up to interval
!    NSUB, which has endpoints XN(NSUB-1) and XN(NSUB).

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ADIAG(NU), the "diagonal" coefficients. 
!    That is, ADIAG(I) is the coefficient of the I-th unknown in 
!    the I-th equation.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ALEFT(NU), the "left hand" coefficients.  That is, 
!    ALEFT(I) is the coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
!    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ARITE(NU).
!    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
!    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
!    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
!    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) F(NSUB+1) or F(NU).
!    ASSEMB stores into F the right hand side of the linear
!    equations.
!    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
!    linear equations.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) H(NSUB)
!    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
!    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) IBC.
!    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
!    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
!    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) INDX(0:NSUB).
!    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
!    associated with node I.
!    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
!    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
!    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
!    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
!    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node NSUB, which will be unknown NSUB or NSUB+1,
!    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NL.
!    The number of basis functions used in a single
!    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
!    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
!    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NODE(NL,NSUB).
!    For each subinterval I:
!    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
!    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NQUAD.
!    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
!    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NSUB.
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NU.
!    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
!    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be NSUB-1,
!    NSUB, or NSUB+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
!    of basis functions.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) UL.
!    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) UR.
!    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XL.
!    XL is the left endpoint of the interval over which the
!    differential equation is being solved.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XN(0:NSUB).
!    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
!    and XN(NSUB) is XR.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XQUAD(NSUB)
!    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
!    in interval I.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XR.
!    XR is the right endpoint of the interval over which the
!    differential equation is being solved.

!! ASSEMBLE assembles the matrix and right-hand-side of the linear system.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The linear system has the form:
!
!      K * C  =  F
!
!    that is to be solved for the coefficients C.
!
!    Numerical integration is used to compute the entries of K and F.
!
!    Note that a 1 point quadrature rule, which is sometimes used to
!    assemble the matrix and right hand side, is just barely accurate
!    enough for simple problems.  If you want better results, you
!    should use a quadrature rule that is more accurate.
