      <b>fd1d_advection_lax_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls fd1d_advection_lax(), which
      applies the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the Lax method for the time,
      writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.
