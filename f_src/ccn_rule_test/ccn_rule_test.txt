CCN_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a nested Clenshaw Curtis rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) dx
  of order N.
 
  The user specifies N, A, B and FILENAME.
 
  N is the number of points;
  A is the left endpoint;
  B is the right endpoint;
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  N =        9
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "ccn_o9".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "ccn_o9".
 
  Weight file will be   "ccn_o9_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "ccn_o9_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "ccn_o9_r.txt".
 
CCN_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
