  Five tetrahedron quality measures per tetrahedron
  written to the file "cube_quality.txt".
 
  Here is a numerical histogram of the "order" of
  each node in the mesh, that is, the number of
  tetrahedrons that include that node as a vertex.
 
  For a regular mesh, most nodes would have the
  same order.
