!
!! MAIN is the main program for FEM1D_ADAPTIVE.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    FEM1D_ADAPTIVE solves a 1D problem using an adaptive finite element method.
!
!    The equation to be treated is:
!
!      -d/dx ( P(x) * dU(x)/dx ) + Q(x) * U(x)  =  F(x)
!
!    by the finite-element method using piecewise linear basis
!    functions.
!
!    An adaptive method is used to try to reduce the maximum
!    error by refining the mesh in certain places.
!
!    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
!    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
!
!    The values of U at XL and XR are also specified.
!
!    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with N+1 points,
!
!      XN(0) = XL, XN(1) = XL+H, XN(2) = XL+2*H, ..., XN(N) = XR.
!
!    This creates N subintervals, with interval I having endpoints
!    XN(I-1) and XN(I).
!
!
!    The algorithm tries to guarantee a certain amount
!    of accuracy by examining the current solution, estimating the error
!    in each subinterval, and, if necessary, subdividing one or more
!    subintervals and repeating the calculation.
!
!    We can think of the adaptive part of the algorithm as a refined
!    problem.  The program re-solves the problem on the pair of
!    intervals J and J+1, which extend from node J-1 to node J+1.
!    The values of U that were just computed at nodes J-1 and J+1
!    will be used as the boundary values for this refined problem.
!    The intervals J and J+1 will each be evenly divided into NY
!    smaller subintervals.  This boundary value problem is solved,
!    and the derivatives of the original and refined solutions are
!    then compared to get an estimate of the error.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ADIAG(NU).
!    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
!    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ALEFT(NU).
!    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
!    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
!    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ARITE(NU).
!    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
!    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
!    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
!    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ETA(N).
!    ETA(I) is the error estimate for interval I.  It is computed
!    as the sum of two quantities, one associated with the left
!    and one with the right node of the interval.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) F(NU).
!    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
!    equations.
!    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
!    linear equations.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) FY(M).
!    FY is the right hand side of the linear system of the refined
!    problem.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) H(N)
!    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
!    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) HY(M).
!    HY(I) is the length of subinterval I in the refined problem.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) IBC.
!    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
!    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
!    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) IBCY.
!    IBCY declares the boundary conditions for the refined problem
!    which should always be that the value of U is specified at
!    both the left and right endpoints.  This corresponds to a
!    value of IBCY = 3.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) INDX(0:N).
!    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
!    associated with node I.
!    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
!    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
!    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
!    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
!    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
!    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) INDY(0:M).
!    INDY(I) records the index of the unknown associated with
!    node I for the refined problem.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) JADD(N).
!    JADD(I) is 1 if the error estimates show that interval I
!    should be subdivided.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) KOUNT, the number of adaptive steps that have 
!    been taken.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) M.
!    M is the number of subintervals used in the refined problem.
!    M is equal to NY for computations centered at node 0 or node N,
!    and otherwise, M is equal to 2*NY.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) N
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval
!    [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NL.
!    The number of basis functions used in a single
!    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
!    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
!    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that can be
!    handled.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NODE(NL,N).
!    For each subinterval I:
!    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
!    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NODEY(NL,M).
!    NODEY performs the same function for the refined problem that
!    NODE performs for the full problem, recording the node numbers
!    associated with a particular subinterval.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NQUAD
!    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NU.
!    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.

!    The number of unknowns in the refined problem.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NY.

!    subdivide any interval.
!    * 2, u = x*x, p = 1, q = 0, f = -2, ibc = 3, ul = 0, ur = 1.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) H(N)
!    H(I) is the length of subinterval I.  This code uses
!    equal spacing for all the subintervals.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) IBC.
!    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
!    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
!    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) INDX(0:N).
!    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
!    associated with node I.
!    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
!    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
!    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
!    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
!    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
!    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval
!    [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NL.
!    The number of basis functions used in a single
!    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
!    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
!    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that 
!    can be handled.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) NODE(NL,N).
!    For each subinterval I:
!    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
!    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NQUAD
!    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
!
!    Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) NU.
!    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
!    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
!    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
!    of basis functions.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) WQUAD(NQUAD).
!    WQUAD(I) is the weight associated with the I-th point
!    of an NQUAD point Gaussian quadrature rule.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) XN(0:N).

!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) KOUNT, the number of adaptive steps that 
!    have been taken.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) N
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval
!    [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NMAX, the maximum number of unknowns that 
!    can be handled.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) TOL.
!    A tolerance that is used to determine whether the estimated
!    error in an interval is so large that it should be subdivided
!    and the problem solved again.
!
!    Input/output, real ( kind = 8 ) XN(0:N).
!    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
