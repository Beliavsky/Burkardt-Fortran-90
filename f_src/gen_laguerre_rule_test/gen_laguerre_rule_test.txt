GEN_LAGUERRE_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a generalized Gauss-Laguerre rule for approximating
    Integral ( a <= x < +oo ) |x-a|^ALPHA exp(-B*(x-a)) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, A, B, and FILENAME.
 
  ORDER is the number of points.
  ALPHA is the exponent of |X|.
  A is the left endpoint, (typically 0).
  B is the scale factor, (typically 1).
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
  * filename_w.txt - the weight file
  * filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =        4
  ALPHA =   0.500000    
  A =    0.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "gen_lag_o4_a0.5".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "gen_lag_o4_a0.5".
 
  Weight file will be   "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_r.txt".
 
GEN_LAGUERRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
