PYRAMID_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a quadrature rule for approximating
  the integral of a function over a pyramid.
 
  The user specifies:
 
  LEGENDRE_ORDER, the order of the Legendre rule for X and Y.
  JACOBI_ORDER, the order of the Jacobi rule for Z,
  FILENAME, the prefix of the three output files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  The requested Legendre order of the rule is        2
 
  The requested Jacobi order of the rule is        4
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "pyramid_l2x2_j4".
 
  Weight file will be   "pyramid_l2x2_j4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "pyramid_l2x2_j4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "pyramid_l2x2_j4_r.txt".
 
PYRAMID_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
