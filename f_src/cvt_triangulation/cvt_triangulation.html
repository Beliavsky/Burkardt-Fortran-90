    <p>
      <b>CVT_TRIANGULATION</b>
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      applies Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) methods to produce 
      triangularizations of various test regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that, when using this code, we begin with a region,
      which is to be filled up with a number of (unspecified) points
      and triangularized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other codes, such as TABLE_DELAUNAY are available for
      the case where the points are already given, and only the triangles
      need to be determined.

      DISTMESH</a>,
      a MATLAB code which
      takes the definition of
      a 2D region, and fills it up with a set of nodes, and triangulates
      those nodes to make a triangulation of the region.  The region may
      be nonconvex and may include holes; the user may request a specific
      density for the nodes, and may require certain points to be in the
      set of nodes.

      <a href = "../../f_src/plot_points/plot_points.html">
      PLOT_POINTS</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can be used to make simple plots of
      the computed points.  For nonconvex regions, the
      Delaunay plots can be confusing.  The plotting code is
      simple-minded, and merrily draws sides of triangles that
      go through holes or areas exterior to the region.  In a few
      cases, it has been possible to draw the outline of the boundary
      of the region, but PLOT_POINTS cannot do very much in this regard.
