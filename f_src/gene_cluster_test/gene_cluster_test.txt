GENE_CLUSTER
  FORTRAN90 version
  Arrange gene expression data into clusters.
 
 
Enter the name of the data file
 
  Data will be read from the file i1039.dat
 
FILE_COLUMN_COUNT - Warning!
  The file does not seem to contain any data.
 
  Spatial dimension is            0
  Number of data points is        0
 
Enter lower and upper number of clusters
 
  CLUSTER_HI exceeds number of points.
 
  The program will try to determine the minimum energy
  of a clustering, for cluster sizes in the range:
             1           0
 
Enter number of different random configurations to check
 
  For each number of clusters, the number of
  distinct initial random configurations to be checked
  will be        60
 
Enter the number of energy iterations
 
  For each initial random configuration, the number of
  times the program will recompute the cluster centers,
  cluster components, and energy is       40
 
  Minimum and maximum data values:
