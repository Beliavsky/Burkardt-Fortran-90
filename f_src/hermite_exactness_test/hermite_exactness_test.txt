HERMITE_EXACTNESS
  FORTRAN90 version
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Hermite
  quadrature rule by integrating weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the (-oo,+oo) interval.
 
HERMITE_EXACTNESS: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "hermite_probabilist_010_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "hermite_probabilist_010_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "hermite_probabilist_010_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =       10
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =       10
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Hermite rule
  of ORDER =       10
 
  OPTION = 4, the probabilist normalized weighted rule for:
  Integral ( -oo < x < +oo ) f(x) * exp(-x*x/2)/sqrt(2pi) dx
