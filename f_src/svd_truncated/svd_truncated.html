      SVD_TRUNCATED <br> The Truncated Singular Value Decomposition
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SVD_TRUNCATED</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      demonstrates the computation of the reduced or truncated 
      Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
      of an M by N rectangular matrix, in cases where M < N or N < M.
    </p>

    <p>
      The singular value decomposition of an M by N rectangular matrix A has
      the form
      <pre>
        A(mxn) = U(mxm) * S(mxn) * V'(nxn)
      </pre>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          U is an orthogonal matrix, whose columns are the left singular vectors;
        </li>
        <li>
          S is a diagonal matrix, whose min(m,n) diagonal entries are the singular values;
        </li>
        <li>
          V is an orthogonal matrix, whose columns are the right singular vectors;
        </li>
      </ul>
      Note that the transpose of V is used in the decomposition, and that the diagonal matrix
      S is typically stored as a vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is often the case that the matrix A has one dimension much bigger than the other.
      For instance, M = 3 and N = 10,000 might be such a case.
      For such examples, much of the computation and memory required for the standard SVD
      may not actually be needed.  Instead, a truncated, or reduced version is appropriate.
      It will be computed faster, and require less memory to store the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      If M < N, we have the "truncated V" SVD:
      <pre>
        A(mxn) = U(mxm) * Sm(mxm) * Vm'(nxm)
      </pre>
      Notice that, for our example, we will have to compute and store a Vm of size
      30,000 instead of a V of size 1,000,000 entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      If N < M, we have the "truncated U" SVD:
      <pre>
        A(mxn) = Un(mxn) * Sn(nxn) * V'(nxn)
      </pre>
      Similarly, in this case, the computation and storage of Un can be much reduced
      from that of U.
    </p>

    <p>
      The LAPACK routines CGESVD, DGESVD, SGESVD and ZGESVD compute the SVD for
      a rectangular matrix in single or double precision, real or complex arithmetic.
      These routines include some options that allow you to request a reduced or
      truncated SVD computation, but the exact details of how to do this may be 
      a little obscure.  This program demonstrates how it is done.
    </p>

      In order to compile and load this program, you need to have access to a
      copy of LAPACK.
