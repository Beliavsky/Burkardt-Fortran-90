CLENSHAW_CURTIS_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Clenshaw Curtis rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, A, B and FILENAME.
 
  ORDER is the number of points;
  A is the left endpoint;
  B is the right endpoint;
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =        5
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "cc_o5".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "cc_o5".
 
  Weight file will be   "cc_o5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "cc_o5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "cc_o5_r.txt".
 
CLENSHAW_CURTIS_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
