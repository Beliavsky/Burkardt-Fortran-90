      TRIANGULATION_QUAD <br>
      Integral Estimate Over a Triangulated Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TRIANGULATION_QUAD</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      reads information defining a triangulation, and estimates the integral of
      a function whose values are given at the nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this program only expects to recieve values of the function <b>f(x,y)</b>
      at the nodes of the triangulation, that is, as a simple list of values.  No formula
      for <b>f</b> is expected or used.  A much better estimate for the integral might
      be possible if a formula for <b>f(x,y)</b> were available, in which case a higher
      order quadrature scheme could be employed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program should be able to compute exactly the integrals of 1, x, y, and any
      linear combination of these.  It will only be able to approximate the integrals
      of other functions, and the accuracy of the approximation will depend in part
      on the size of the triangles in the triangulation.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_quad</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>'prefix'</i> is the common prefix for the node, element, and value files.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,    the node coordinates;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_elements.txt</b>,    the elements of the triangulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i><b>_values.txt</b>,    the value (which may be a scalar or vector)
          of some function at each node.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>quad</i> is the (scalar or vector) result of the integration estimate, which
          is computed and printed out by the program.
        </li>
      </ul>
