    <p>
      <b>CALENDAR_NYT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      attempts to determine the date, given the volume and issue number of an
      edition of the New York Times, or vice versa.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might think that all that is required is to figure out the first date of
      issue, and then count the number of days that have elapsed from then to the
      date of interest, to get the issue number.  That's why I thought too, but it's
      not that simple by any means!
    </p>

    <p>
      The routines <b>YMD_TO_NYT</b> and <b>JED_TO_NYT</b> are fairly trustworthy.
      The first routine immediately refers to the second, which has been
      compared to a sample of issue numbers of all the front pages issued in a recent
      commemorative book.  The actual details of how the issue number was occasionally
      garbled, held back, or incremented involve about 30 corrections to the
      simplistic idea of counting the number of days from the first issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "inverse" routines <b>NYT_TO_JED</b> and <b>NYT_TO_YMD</b> work from
      about 1905 onwards, after which there were only two disruptions to the simple
      issue incrementing.  Before that time, the formula has not been "educated"
      about the various irregularities in the issue numbering system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The routine <b>JED_TO_NYT_ISSUE_IDEAL</b> assigns to each successive
      issue of the New York Times a unique identifier, namely, its sequence number.
      This is what the nominal issue number was supposed to do.  Using this function,
      we can see that the actual number of issues of the New York Times printed
      from the beginning up to 1 April 2008 was not 54,267, (the nominal issue number)
      but instead 56,570!
