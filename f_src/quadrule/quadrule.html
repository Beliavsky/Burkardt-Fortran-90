      QUADRULE <br> Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADRULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      sets up a variety of
      quadrature rules, used to approximate the integral of a function
      over various domains in 1D.
    </p>

    <p>
      QUADRULE returns the abscissas and weights for a variety of
      one dimensional quadrature rules for approximating the integral
      of a function.  The best rule is generally Gauss-Legendre quadrature,
      but other rules offer special features, including the ability to
      handle certain weight functions, to approximate an integral
      on an infinite integration region, or to estimate the approximation
      error.
