      UNICYCLE <br> Permutations with a Single Cycle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>UNICYCLE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out some operations on permutations with a single cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      A permutation with a single cycle is a permutation P of N objects
      with the property that, for every object, it takes exactly N applications
      of P to restore an object to its original value.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to think of this is that a permutation with a single cycle
      can be symbolized by a bracelet with N beads; the action of the permutation
      is to rotate the bracelet one position.
    </p>

    <p>
      A permutation with a single cycle can be written in "sequence" form.
      Assuming the objects are labeled 1 through N, we start with 1, followed
      by P(1), followed by P(P(1)), and so on.  Thus, the sequence (1,4,2,5,3)
      indicates the permutation which maps 1->4, 2->5, 3->1, 4->2, and 5->3.
    </p>

    <p>
      A permutation with a single cycle is sometimes called a "cyclic permutation",
      but this term is also used with other meanings.  Hence, we will affectionately
      call these objects "unicycles".
