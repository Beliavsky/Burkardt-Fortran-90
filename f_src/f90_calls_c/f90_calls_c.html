      F90_CALLS_C <br> FORTRAN90 code Calls C Function
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>F90_CALLS_C</b>
      is a directory which demonstrates how a FORTRAN90 code can
      call a C function in a way that is "guaranteed" to work; in other
      words, the procedure follows rules laid down by the FORTRAN standard,
      and does not depend on any special or peculiar features of the
      FORTRAN and C compilers used to compile the codes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some reference books discuss this topic by showing little isolated
      pieces of code, which do not form a real code, and cannot actually
      be compiled or used.  Since EVERYTHING has to be correctly written and
      working properly together to make this delicate operation happen, it
      is very important to have an entire calculation in mind, and to be able
      to examine the full FORTRAN and C source code, as well as the compile
      and load statements used.
    </p>

    <p>
      The KRONROD example presented here involves a FORTRAN90 main code
      and a code of 4 C routines.  For comparison, you can also look at
      a directory where the same calculation is done with the main code
      and code routines written in the same language.  Simply go to
      the KRONROD directory for the language you are interested in.
    </p>

    <p>
      A FORTRAN90 code, subroutine, or function that will call a C function
      might try using the ISO C binding module.  This was actually introduced
      as part of FORTRAN 2003, but your compiler may be willing to let your
      FORTRAN90 code access it.  (If not, you might consider moving to
      FORTRAN 2003!).  The ISO C bindings are made available by the statement:
      <pre>
        use iso_c_binding
      </pre>
      You can also use fussier versions of this statement, such as
      <pre>
        use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
        use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding, only : C_CHAR, C_NULL_CHAR
      </pre>
      (Thanks to Alan Richardson for pointing out that the ISO C bindings
      were only added to the language in the 2003 definition of FORTRAN!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you have the C bindings, you need to define an interface to your
      C function, which might read:
      <pre>
  interface
    subroutine kronrod ( n, eps, x, w1, w2 ) bind ( c )
      use iso_c_binding
      integer ( c_int ), VALUE :: n
      real ( c_double ), VALUE :: eps
      real ( c_double ) :: x(*)
      real ( c_double ) :: w1(*)
      real ( c_double ) :: w2(*)
    end subroutine kronrod
  end interface
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, to guarantee that FORTRAN and C agree on data types, you should
      declare any FORTRAN90 variables that will be passed through the C interface
      with statements like this, which essentially specify the appropriate KIND
      parameter to guarantee compatibility:
      <pre>
  integer ( c_int ), parameter :: n = 3
  real ( c_double ) eps
  real ( c_double ) x(n+1)
  real ( c_double ) w1(n+1)
  real ( c_double ) w2(n+1)
      </pre>
    </p>

      The <b>HELLO</b> example involves a FORTRAN90 main code
      which calls directly the C function "print_C".  The C function
      prints a string which is passed from the FORTRAN90 code.
      Notice that, in the output file, the output from the C function appears
      BEFORE the output from the FORTRAN main code.
