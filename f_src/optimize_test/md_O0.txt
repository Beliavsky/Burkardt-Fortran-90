MD
  FORTRAN90 version
  A molecular dynamics program.
 
  Enter ND, the spatial dimension (2 or 3 ):
 
  Enter NP, the number of particles (500, for instance):
 
  Enter STEP_NUM, the number of time steps (500, for instance):
 
  ND, the spatial dimension, is        3
  NP, the number of particles in the simulation is     1000
  STEP_NUM, the number of time steps, is      400
  DT, the size of each time step, is   0.100000E-03
 
  Initializing positions, velocities, and accelerations.
 
  Computing initial forces and energies.
 
  At each step, we report the potential and kinetic energies.
  The sum of these energies should be a constant.
  As an accuracy check, we also print the relative error
  in the total energy.
