    <p>
      <b>GRAPH_PAPER</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 library which
      makes graph paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      GRAPH_PAPER generates simple Encapsulated PostScript files
      (EPS) representing several styles of graph paper.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I manage to find a pad of printed graph paper, I use it all
      up in a week.  Right now, there are just a couple of options
      involving simple plain grids, but more may come.
