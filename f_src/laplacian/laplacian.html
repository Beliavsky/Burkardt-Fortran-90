      LAPLACIAN <br> The Discrete Laplacian Operator
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAPLACIAN</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out computations related to the discrete 
      Laplacian operator, including full or sparse evaluation,
      evaluation for unequally spaced data sampling points, 
      application to a set of data samples, solution of associated
      linear systems, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and extension
      to 2D and 3D geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a (twice-continuously differentiable) function U(X) of 
      a one-dimensional variable X, the (continuous)
      Laplacian operator L(U)(X) is simply the second derivative:
      <pre>
        L(U)(X) = d^2 U(X)/dX^2
      </pre>
      for a function of two dimensions, we have
      <pre>
        L(U)(X,Y) = d^2 U(X,Y)/dX^2 + d^2 U(X,Y)/dY^2
      </pre>
      and so on.  The Laplacian is important mathematically because
      it arises naturally in the mathematical model of many important
      physical systems, such as the variation of temperature in a 
      heated object.
    </p>

    <p>
      The discrete Laplacian is an approximation to the continuous
      Laplacian that is appropriate when data is known or sampled
      only at finitely many points.  It is often the case that these
      points are evenly spaced in a line or grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The one-dimensional discrete Laplacian
      Suppose that a function U(X) is known at three points X-H, X and X+H.
      Then the discrete Laplacian operator, applied
      to this data, is simply the standard approximation to the second
      derivative:
      <pre>
        L(U)(X) = ( + 2 U(X) 
                    -   U(X-H)
                    -   U(X+H) ) / H^2
      </pre>
      The 2-dimensional analog, assuming that (X,Y) data is available
      at the uniform spacing H, is:
      <pre>
        L(U)(X,Y) = ( + 4 U(X,Y)
                      -   U(X-H,Y-H) - U(X-H,Y+H)
                      -   U(X+H,Y-H) - U(X+H,Y+H) ) / H^2
      </pre>
      and similar results apply for higher dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the data is not available at equally spaced points, then
      the computation becomes somewhat more involved.  However, simply
      using Taylor series, we have:
      <pre>
        U(X+H1) = U(X) + U' * H1 + U'' * H1^2 / 2 + U''' H1^3 / 6 + ...
        U(X+H2) = U(X) + U' * H2 + U'' * H2^2 / 2 + U''' H2^3 / 6 + ...
      </pre>
      from which we can determine that:
      <pre>
        H2 * U(X+H1) - H1 * U(X+H2) - ( H2 - H1 ) * U(X) =
          ( H2 * H1^2 / 2 - H1 * H2^2 / 2 ) * U''
        + ( H2 * H1^3 / 6 - H1 * H3^3 / 6 ) * U'''
        + higher order terms
      </pre>
      and hence, we have the approximation: 
      <pre>
        L(U)(X) = ( H2 * U(X+H1) - H1 * U(X+H2) - ( H2 - H1 ) * U(X) )
                / ( H2 * H1^2 / 2 - H1 * H2^2 / 2 )
      </pre>
      Again, corresponding results can be determined for higher dimensions,
      in cases where the data is sampled along coordinate lines, but with
      nonuniform spacing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, let us consider the 1-dimensional case, where U(X) is 
      available at N+2 points equally spaced by H, and indexed from
      0 to N+1.  Let U now be the 
      vector of values U(X(0)), U(X(2)), ..., U(X(N+1)), and let
      U(i) indicate the function value U(X(i)).  For all but the first and
      last indices, it is easy to estimate the second derivative, using
      the formula:
      <pre>
        L(Ui) = U''(i) = ( - U(i-1) + 2 U(i) - U(i+1) ) / h^2 
      </pre>
      This is a linear operation.  It takes N+2 values U and produces
      N values L(Ui), for i = 1 to N.  It has the matrix form:
      <pre>
        L(Ui) = L * U
      </pre>
      where the N by N+2 matrix L has the form (if N = 4, and H = 1 ):
      <pre>
         -1  2 -1  0  0  0
          0 -1  2 -1  0  0
          0  0 -1  2 -1  0
          0  0  0 -1  2 -1
      </pre>
      Square matrices are much more convenient for analysis, so let us
      assume either that U(1) and U(N) are zero, or that we can somehow
      neglect or defer the analysis of the first and last columns.  In that
      case, we have our first example of a discrete Laplacian matrix,
      in this case for N = 4 and H = 1:
      <pre>
           2 -1  0  0 
          -1  2 -1  0 
           0 -1  2 -1 
           0  0 -1  2 
      </pre>
    </p>

          instead derivative information or periodic boundary conditions
          are applied;
        </li>
