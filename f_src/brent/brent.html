    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>BRENT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      contains algorithms for finding zeros or minima of
      a scalar function of a scalar variable,
      by Richard Brent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The methods do not require the use of derivatives, and do not assume that
      the function is differentiable.
