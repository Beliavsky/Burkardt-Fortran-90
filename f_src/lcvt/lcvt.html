      LCVT <br> Latin Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LCVT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      creates Latin Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Latin Square dataset is typically a two dimensional dataset
      of N points in the unit square, with the property that, if both the
      <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> axes are divided up into <b>N</b> equal subintervals,
      exactly one dataset point has an <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> coordinate in
      each subinterval.  Latin squares can easily be extended to the
      case of <b>M</b> dimensions, and may be pedantically called <i>Latin
      Hypersquares</i> or <i>Latin Hypercubes</i> in such a case.
      Statisticians like Latin Squares, as
      do experiment designers, and and people who need to approximate
      scalar functions of many variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fact that the projection of a Latin Square dataset onto any
      coordinate axis is either exactly evenly spaced, or approximately
      so (depending on the algorithm), turns out to be an attractive
      feature for many uses.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, a CVT dataset in a regular domain, such as the unit
      hypercube, has the tendency for the projections of the points
      to cluster together in any coordinate axis.  This program is
      mainly an attempt to explore whether a dataset can be computed
      using techniques similar to those of a CVT, but with the
      constraint (whether imposed or expected) that the point projections
      do not clump up.
    </p>

    <p>
      The approach used here is quite simple.  First we compute a CVT
      in M dimensions, comprising N points.  We assume that the bounding
      region is the unit hypercube.  We are now going to adjust the
      coordinates of the points to achieve the Latin Hypercube property.
      For each coordinate direction, we simply sort the points by that
      coordinate, and then overwrite the original values by the values
      we'd expect to get for a centered Latin Hypercube, namely,
      1/(2*N), 3/(2*N), ..., (2*N-1)/(2*N).
    </p>

    <p>
      Now this process guarantees that we get a Latin Hypercube.  Our
      hope is that the process of adjusting the point coordinates does
      not too severely damage the nice dispersion properties inherent
      in the CVT point placement.
