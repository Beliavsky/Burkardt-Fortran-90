      IMAGE_EDGE <br> Edge Detection in Images
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_EDGE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      detects edges in an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      NEWS is a particularly simple edge detection scheme, which compares
      the North, East, West, and South neighbors of a pixel to determine
      if the pixel lies along an edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many sophisticated edge detection algorithms, and MATLAB
      has many of them built into its image processing toolbox.  The purpose
      of these examples is simply to demonstrate how a simple version of
      such edge detection schemes works.
