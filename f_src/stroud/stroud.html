      STROUD <br> Numerical Integration<br> in M Dimensions
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STROUD</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      defines quadrature rules for a variety of M-dimensional regions, 
      including the interior of the square, cube and hypercube, the pyramid,
      cone and ellipse, the hexagon, the M-dimensional octahedron,
      the circle, sphere and hypersphere, the triangle, tetrahedron and simplex,
      and the surface of the circle, sphere and hypersphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      A few other rules have been collected as well, 
      particularly for quadrature over the interior of a triangle, which is 
      useful in finite element calculations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arthur Stroud published his vast collection of quadrature formulas
      for multidimensional regions in 1971.  In a few cases, he printed 
      sample FORTRAN77 programs to compute these integrals.  Integration 
      regions included:
