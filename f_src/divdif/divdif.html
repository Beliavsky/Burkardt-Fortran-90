      DIVDIF <br> Divided Difference Polynomials

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DIVDIF</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 library which
      creates, prints and manipulates divided difference polynomials
      based on data tabulated at evenly spaced or unevenly spaced argument values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Divided difference polynomials are a
      systematic method of computing polynomial approximations to scattered
      data.  The representations are compact, and may easily be updated with
      new data, rebased at zero, or analyzed to produce the standard form
      polynomial, integral or derivative polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other routines are available to convert the divided difference
      representation to standard polynomial format.  This is a natural
      way to determine the coefficients of the polynomial that interpolates
      a given set of data, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      One surprisingly simple but useful routine is available to take
      a set of roots and compute the divided difference or standard form
      polynomial that passes through those roots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the Newton-Cotes quadrature formulas can be derived using
      divided difference methods, so a few routines are given which can
      compute the weights and abscissas of open or closed rules for an
      arbitrary number of nodes.
