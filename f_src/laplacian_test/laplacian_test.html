      <b>laplacian_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls laplacian(), which
      carries out computations related to the discrete 
      Laplacian operator, including full or sparse evaluation,
      evaluation for unequally spaced data sampling points, 
      application to a set of data samples, solution of associated
      linear systems, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and extension
      to 2D and 3D geometry.
