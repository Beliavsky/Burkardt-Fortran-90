      <b>r8col_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      calls r8col(), which
      contains utility routines for R8COL's, that is,
      double precision real MxN arrays, considered as N column vectors,
      each of length M.  The data may be thought of as a matrix of
      multiple columns, and many operations will be carried out columnwise.
