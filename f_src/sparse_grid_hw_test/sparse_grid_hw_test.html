      <b>sparse_grid_hw_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      calls sparse_grid_hw(), which
      can compute sparse grids for multidimensional integration,
      based on 1D rules for the unit interval with unit weight function,
      or for the real line with the Gauss-Hermite weight function.
      The original MATLAB code is by Florian Heiss and Viktor Winschel.
