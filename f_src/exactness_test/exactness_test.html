      <b>exactness_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls exactness(), which
      investigates the exactness of quadrature rules that estimate the
      integral of a function with a density, such as 1, exp(-x) or
      exp(-x^2), over an interval such as [-1,+1], [0,+oo) or (-oo,+oo).
