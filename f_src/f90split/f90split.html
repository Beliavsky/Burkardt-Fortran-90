      <b>f90split</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      reads a (simple) FORTRAN90 source file, and writes each routine 
      to a separate file with an extension of ".f90".
    </p>

    <p>  
      Here, by "routine", we mean a chunk of text that begins with
      a <b>BLOCKDATA</b>, <b>FUNCTION</b>, <b>MODULE</b>, 
      <b>PROGRAM</b> or <b>SUBROUTINE</b> unit and ends with an <b>END</b> 
      statement.
    </p>

    <p>
      This utility can be convenient when your goal is to create a
      UNIX "AR" archive of the compiled object code.  By splitting
      your source code up, and compiling each routine separately,
      you end up with a library in which each compiled module is
      individual listed and replaceable.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>f90split</b> <i>myprog.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.f90</i> is the file to be split.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of the name of a single file, a pattern can be given, 
      as in:
      <blockquote>
        <b>f90split</b> <i>sub*.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      in which case each file whose name matches the pattern will
      be handled by the program.
