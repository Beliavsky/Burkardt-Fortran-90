TABLE_QUALITY:
  (FORTRAN90 version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.
 
  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.
 
  The pointset was read from "halton_02_00100.txt"
 
  The sampling routine is "SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM".
 
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =                 2
  The number of points N =                  100
  The number of sample points NS =       100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =       123456789
 
  The minimum angle measure    ALPHA =    1.67374    
  The regularity measure         Chi =    5.17460    
  2nd moment determinant measure   D =   0.662849E-06
  The Voronoi energy measure       E =   0.221730E-02
  The mesh ratio               Gamma =    3.36968    
  The point distribution norm      H =   0.124875    
  The COV measure             Lambda =   0.288963    
  The point distribution ratio    Mu =    2.31022    
  The cell volume deviation       Nu =    5.39432    
  The triangle uniformity measure  Q =   0.186193E-02
  The Riesz 0-level energy        R0 =   0.778177    
  Nonintersecting sphere volume    S =   0.406680    
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau =   0.165464E-02
