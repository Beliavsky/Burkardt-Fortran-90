TABLE_QUALITY:
  (FORTRAN90 version):
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.
 
  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.
 
  The pointset was read from "degen.txt"
 
  The sampling routine is "SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM".
 
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =                 2
  The number of points N =                  130
  The number of sample points NS =       100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =       123456789
 
  The minimum angle measure    ALPHA =    0.00000    
  The regularity measure         Chi =    7.9440596    
  2nd moment determinant measure   D =   0.43583167E-07
  The Voronoi energy measure       E =   0.14974058E-02
  The mesh ratio               Gamma =    6.5552162    
  The point distribution norm      H =   0.70548614E-01
  The COV measure             Lambda =   0.15621697    
  The point distribution ratio    Mu =    1.3861126    
  The cell volume deviation       Nu =    34.709677    
  The triangle uniformity measure  Q =    0.0000000    
  The Riesz 0-level energy        R0 =   0.70365607    
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau =   0.10440822E-02
