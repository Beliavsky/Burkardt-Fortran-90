  FORTRAN90 version:
 
  Compute measures of uniform dispersion for a pointset.
 
  Note: this routine assumes that the input pointset
  is contained in the unit hypercube.  If this is not
  the case, then you must rewrite the routine
    SAMPLE_ROUTINE
  so that it properly returns sample points in your
  region, with a uniform density, or a probability
  density of your choosing.
 
  The pointset was read from "cvt_02_00100.txt"
 
  The sampling routine is "SAMPLE_HYPERCUBE_UNIFORM".
 
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =                 2
