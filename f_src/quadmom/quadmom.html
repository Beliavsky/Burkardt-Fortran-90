      QUADMOM <br> Quadrature Rules from Weight Moments
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUADMOM</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes a Gaussian quadrature rule for a weight function rho(x)
      based on the Golub-Welsch procedure that only requires knowledge
      of the moments of rho(x).
    </p>

    <p>
      The standard Golub-Welsch procedure expects to work with the
      coefficients alpha() and beta() of the three term recursion 
      for the orthogonal polynomials associated with the weight function rho(x).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, in the same paper, Golub and Welsch discuss a related procedure
      which, to compute a Gaussian quadrature rule of order N, requires the
      values of the first M=2*N+1 moments associated with rho(x):
      <pre>
        mu(k) = integral x^k rho(x) dx,  0 <= k <= 2*n
      </pre>
      This library demonstrates this moment-based procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Executing the sample program requires access to the TOMS655 library 
      as well.
