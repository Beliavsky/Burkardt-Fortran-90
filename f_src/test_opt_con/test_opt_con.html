      TEST_OPT_CON <br> 
      Test Functions for Scalar Optimization <br>
      Constrained to a Hyper-Rectangle
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_OPT_CON</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines a set of constrained global optimization problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical constrained global optimization problem presents an M-dimensional
      hyper-rectangle bounded by A(1:M) <= X(1:M) <= B(1:M), and a scalar-valued
      function F(X).  The task is to find a point X within the hyper-rectangle
      at which the function takes its minimum value.
    </p>

    <p>
      This task is impossible, mathematically and in general.  However, the problems
      that can be solved mathematically are often not the ones encountered in
      real life.  Thus, it is useful to try to solve an impossible problem, since
      an approximate answer to such a problem can be all we can hope for or need.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions defined include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          NM1: Niederreiter-McCurley function #1, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM2: Niederreiter-McCurley function #2, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM3: Niederreiter-McCurley function #3, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM4: Niederreiter-McCurley function #4, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM5: Niederreiter-McCurley function #5, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM6: Niederreiter-McCurley function #6, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          NM6: Niederreiter-McCurley function #6, M = 4;
        </li>
        <li>
          L02: Langerman function, M = 2;
        </li>
        <li>
          L10: Langerman function, M = 10;
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      For each function, the library includes a routine to evaluate the function,
      but also routines to return the limits of the hyper-rectangle, the
      spatial dimension, the solution, if known, and a title for the problem.
      These routines have a standard set of names based on the function index.
      For instance, for function #3, we have the routines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>P03_AB</b> returns bounds for problem 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P03_F</b> returns the objective function value for problem 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P03_M</b> returns the spatial dimension for problem 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P03_SOL</b> returns known solutions for problem 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P03_TITLE</b> returns a title for problem 3.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the same interface is used for each function,
      if you wish to work with problem 6 instead, you simply change
      the "03" to "06" in your routine calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you wish to call <i>all</i> of the functions, you can write a concise
      program to do so by using the generic interface, in which the function
      names use the prefix <b>P00_</b>, and require the specific problem index
      to be supplied as an extra input argument:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>P00_AB</b> returns bounds for a problem specified by index.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P00_F</b> returns the objective function value for a problem specified by index.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P00_M</b> returns the spatial dimension for a problem specified by index.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P00_SOL</b> returns known solutions for a problem specified by index.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>P00_TITLE</b> returns a title for a problem specified by index.
        </li>
      </ul>
