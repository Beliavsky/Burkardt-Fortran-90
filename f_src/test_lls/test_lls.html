      TEST_LLS <br> Linear Least Squares Test Problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>test_lls</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements linear least squares (LLS) test problems 
      which are given A and b, and seek a vector x which 
      minimizes the L2 norm of the error ||Ax-b||.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some linear least squares problems include constraints on the data,
      such as requiring that every entry of X be positive.  This library
      only contains unconstrained problems.  For such problems, the task is
      typically to find a vector X which minimizes the Euclidean norm of
      the residual r=Ax-b, or, in cases where multiple minimizers exist,
      to find the minimizer of minimal Euclidean norm.
    </p>

    <p>
      TEST_LLS requires access to a compiled copy of the R8LIB library.
