gen_laguerre_exactness
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a generalized Gauss-Laguerre
  quadrature rule by integrating exponentially weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the [0,+oo) interval.
 
  The rule may be defined on another interval, [A,+oo)
  in which case it is adjusted to the [0,+oo) interval.
 
gen_laguerre_exactness: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "gen_lag_o4_a0.5_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =       10
  Weighting function exponent ALPHA =   0.500000    
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        4
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a generalized Gauss-Laguerre rule
  ORDER =        4
  A =        0.00000    
  ALPHA =   0.500000    
 
  OPTION = 0, standard rule:
    Integral ( A <= x < +oo ) x^alpha exp(-x) f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).

  A generalized Gauss-Laguerre rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        7
