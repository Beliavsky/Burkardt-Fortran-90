      <b>makefile_test</b>
      FORTRAN90 codes which
      use a "makefile", which
      manages the compilation and loading of a FORTRAN90 code.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A makefile is usually stored in a file named <i>makefile</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of a makefile is to record or infer the commands
      necessary to compile and load a program (or, more generally,
      to "build" a program or object that depends on objects),
      to intelligently automate this task, and to efficiently
      update all objects that depend on an object that has itself
      just been updated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most natural example for which a makefile is useful would
      involve the relationship between several text files containing
      F90 routines (with extension ".f90"),
      the object files created by compiling separately each F90 file
      (with extension ".o"), and the executable program that can be
      created by loading them all together (which, by default, is
      called "a.out", but which we will rename to "f90_simple".
    </p>

    <p>
      We suppose we start with files <i>f90_simple.f90</i>, <i>midpoint.f90</i>,
      and <i>f.f90</i>.  If we wished to build the
      executable <i>f90_simple</i>, we need to create <i>f90_simple.o</i>,
      <i>midpoint.o</i>, <i>f.o</i>, and then load them together,
      and rename the result to <i>f90_simple</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "dependencies" or relationships between these files can
      be thought of as follows:
      <pre>
        <b>f90_simple</b> needs <i>f90_simple.o</i>, <i>midpoint.o</i> and <i>f.o</i>.
          The commands to create <b>f90_simple</b> are
          f90 f90_simple.o midpoint.o sub2.o
          mv a.out f90_simple

        <b>f90_simple.o</b> needs <i>f90_simple.f90</i>.
          The command to create <b>f90_simple.o</b> is
          f90 -c f90_simple.f90

        <b>midpoint.o</b> needs <i>midpoint.f90</i>.
          The command to create <b>midpoint.o</b> is
          f90 -c midpoint.f90

        <b>f.o</b> needs <i>f.f90</i>.
          The command to create <b>f.o</b> is
          f90 -c f.f90
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The corresponding makefile records these relationships.  Each
      <i>dependency line</i> lists a "target" (something you want to make),
      followed by a colon, and then a list of the components on which that
      target depends.  There follow one or more <i>command lines</i> that
      tell how to put the components together to make the target.  Note
      that each command line must begin with a TAB character.  We will
      use the symbol <b>--TAB--&gt;</b> to suggest this.  Here is what the
      makefile would look like
      <pre>
        <b>f90_simple</b> : <i>f90_simple.o</i> <i>midpoint.o</i> <i>f.o</i>
        <i>--TAB--&gt;</i> f90 f90_simple.o midpoint.o f.o
        <i>--TAB--&gt;</i> mv a.out f90_simple
        <b>f90_simple.o</b> : <i>f90_simple.f90</i>
        <i>--TAB--&gt;</i> f90 -c f90_simple.f90
        <b>midpoint.o</b> : <i>midpoint.f90</i>
        <i>--TAB--&gt;</i> f90 -c midpoint.f90
        <b>f.o</b> : <i>f.f90</i>
        <i>--TAB--&gt;</i> f90 -c f.f90
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To create the program, type <i>make f90_simple</i>.  If you just
      edited <b>midpoint.f90</b> and want only to recompile it, type
      <i>make midpoint.o</i>.  But if you just edited <b>midpoint.f90</b>,
      and you want to recompile it, and then also recreate the program,
      then type <i>make f90_simple</i>.  The <b>make</b> program will notice
      that <i>midpoint.f90</i> has been updated, and automatically
      recompile it, and then rebuild <b>f90_simple</b>.
