LEGENDRE_RULE_FAST
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Gauss-Legendre rule for approximating
 
    Integral ( b <= x <= b ) f(x) dx
 
  of order N.
 
  The computed rule is written to 3 files:
 
    leg_oN_w.txt - the weight file
    leg_oN_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    leg_oN_r.txt - the region file.
 
  The requested order N       15
 
  The left endpoint A is    0.00000    
 
  The right endpoint B is    2.00000    
 
  Computation required   0.150000E-03 seconds.
 
  Weight file will be   "leg_o15_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "leg_o15_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "leg_o15_r.txt".
 
LEGENDRE_RULE_FAST:
  Normal end of execution.
