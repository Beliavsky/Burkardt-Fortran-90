 
MAXIMUM:
  FORTRAN90/OpenMP version
 
  OpenMP allows FORTRAN programs to compute a maximum
  as a reduction variable.  How does this work exactly?
  The number of processors available =        8
  The number of threads available    =        1
 
  X_MAX should be      1.94562    
  Computed X_MAX2 =    1.94562    
  Computed X_MAX3 =    1.94562    
 
MAXIMUM:
  Normal end of execution.
