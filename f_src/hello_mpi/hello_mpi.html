    <p>
      <b>HELLO_MPI</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      prints out "Hello, World!", while invoking the MPI parallel programming
      system.

    <p>
      If you're just trying to learn MPI, or learning how to use
      MPI on a different computer system, or in batch mode, it's helpful
      if you start with a very simple program with a tiny amount of output
      that should print immediately if things are working well.
