      TABLE_QUALITY <br> Interactive Program for <br> Point Dispersion Quality
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TABLE_QUALITY</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      reads a data file containing
      the coordinates of N points in an M dimensional region,
      and computes some measures of the quality of dispersion
      of the points.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program assumes that the pointset lies in the unit hypercube.
      However, it is easy to modify the program to handle other regions.
      A single routine, named <b>sample_routine</b>, is required to return
      sample points in the region.  To handle a different region,
      simply modify this routine, and rebuild the program.  One other
      built-in routine is already available, for sampling the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unit hypercube in M dimensional space is simply the set of
      all vectors whose entries are between 0 and 1.  It is
      a natural abstraction of the unit line segment, the unit square,
      and the unit cube, and represents a very simple chunk of <b>M</b>
      dimensional space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality measures computed include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Beta</b>, the standard deviation of the minimum spacing
          between nodes, normalized by the average spacing;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chi</b>, the regularity measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>, the second moment determinant measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>E</b>, the Voronoi energy measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma</b>, the mesh ratio;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>H</b>, the point distribution norm;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lambda</b>, the COV measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mu</b>, the point distribution ratio;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nu</b>, the cell volume deviation;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R0</b>, the Riesz S=0 energy;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S</b>, the sphere volume measure
          (unit hypercube datasets only).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tau</b>, the second moment trace measure;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program also prints:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma_min</b>, the minimum spacing between nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma_ave</b>, the average spacing between nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma_max</b>, the maximum spacing between nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma_std</b>, the standard deviation of the spacing
          between nodes;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
