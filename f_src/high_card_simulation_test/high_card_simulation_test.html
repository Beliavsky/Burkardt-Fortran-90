      <b>high_card_simulation_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls high_card_simulation(), which
      simulates a game in which you have one chance to select the highest card
      from a deck, using gnuplot() to display the estimated and exact probabilities.

      high_card_simulation</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      simulates a situation in which you see the cards in a deck one by one,
      and must select the one you think is the highest and stop;
      the program uses gnuplot() for graphics.
