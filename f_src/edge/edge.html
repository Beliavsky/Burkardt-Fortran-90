    <p>
      <b>EDGE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines some test functions in 1D, 2D and 3D for the detection of edges,
      and uses GNUPLOT to display images of the functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, we look at some simple functional examples in 1D,
      2D, and 3D, that is, situations in which a formula is supplied so
      that the value of a scalar quantity f() can be determined at any 
      point in the region.  We are interested in examples in which the
      quantity f() exhibits jumps. that is, sudden, sharp changes in value.
