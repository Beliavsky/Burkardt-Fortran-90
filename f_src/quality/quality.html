      QUALITY <br> Quality Measures for Pointsets in M dimensions
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>QUALITY</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes measures of the quality
      of dispersion of a set of N points in an M dimensional region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The region to be analyzed is defined by a single routine which
      the user may specify.  We will refer to that routine as
      <b>sample_routine</b>.  This routine is simply required to return
      sample points from the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library includes routines for two simple regions, namely
      the unit hypercube and the unit hypersphere.  If either of these
      regions is of interest, then the user simply has to pass the
      appropriate name, either <b>sample_hypercube_uniform</b> or
      <b>sample_sphere_uniform</b>.  For other regions, the user should
      write the appropriate version of a sampling routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unit hypercube in M dimensional space is simply the set of
      all vectors whose entries are between 0 and 1.  It is
      a natural abstraction of the unit line segment, the unit square,
      and the unit cube, and represents a very simple chunk of <b>M</b>
      dimensional space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The unit hypersphere in M dimensional space is simply the set of
      all points whose distance from the origin is 1 or less.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality measures computed include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Alpha</b>, the minimum angle divided by the maximum possible
          minimum angle (for triangulated 2D datasets only);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Area</b>, the ratio of the minimum and maximum triangle
          areas (for triangulated 2D datasets only);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Beta</b>, the standard deviation of the minimum spacing
          between nodes, normalized by the average spacing between nodes;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chi</b>, the regularity measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>D</b>, the second moment determinant measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>E</b>, the Voronoi energy measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Gamma</b>, the mesh ratio;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>H</b>, the point distribution norm;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Lambda</b>, the COV measure;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mu</b>, the point distribution ratio;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nu</b>, the cell volume deviation;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q</b>, two times the radius of the inscribed circle
          divided by the radius of the circumscribed circle
          (for triangulated 2D datasets only);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R0</b>, the Riesz S=0 energy;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S</b>, the sphere volume measure
          (unit hypercube datasets only).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tau</b>, the second moment trace measure;
        </li>
      </ul>
