      ARPACK <br> Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Large Matrices
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>ARPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large matrices,
      by Richard Lehoucq, Danny Sorensen, Chao Yang.
    </p>

    <p>
      ARPACK supports single and double precision, real or complex
      arithmetic.  The matrices involved can be symmetric or nonsymmetric.
      The user can request just a few eigenvalues, or all of them.  There
      are special routines for banded matrices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the package uses reverse communication, the user is
      free to store the matrix in any way suitable.  ARPACK
      will never require direct access to the matrix, only to
      the value of certain matrix-vector products such as <b>A*x</b>
      or <b>A'*x</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      ARPACK includes calls to the LAPACK and BLAS.
      libraries.
