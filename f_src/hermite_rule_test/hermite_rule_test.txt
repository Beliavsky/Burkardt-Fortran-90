HERMITE_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule for
    Integral ( -oo < x < +oo ) f(x) rho(x) dx
  where the weight rho(x) is:
    exp ( - b * ( x - a )^2 ) * sqrt ( b / pi ) dx
  using N points.
 
  The user specifies N, A, B, SCALE, and FILENAME.
 
  * N is the number of points (usually odd).
  * A is the center point (usually 0.0):
  * B is a scale factor (usually 0.5 or 1.0);
  * SCALE is 1 if the weights are to be normalized.
  * FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
  ** filename_w.txt - the weight file
  ** filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  ** filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  N =            4
  A =        0.00000    
  B =        1.00000    
  SCALE =        0
  FILENAME = "herm_o4".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "herm_o4".
 
  Weight file will be   "herm_o4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "herm_o4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "herm_o4_r.txt".
 
HERMITE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
