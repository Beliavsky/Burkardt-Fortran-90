JACOBI_RULE
  C++ version

  Compute a Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) (B-x)^alpha (x-A)^beta f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.

  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, BETA, A, B, and FILENAME.

  ORDER is the number of points.
  ALPHA is the exponent of ( B - x );
  BETA is the exponent of ( x - A );
  A is the left endpoint
  B is the right endpoint
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.

  ORDER = = 4
  ALPHA = 0.5
  BETA = 1.5
  A = -1
  B = 1
  FILENAME is "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5".

  Creating quadrature files.

  Root file name is     "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5".

  Weight file will be   "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_r.txt".

JACOBI_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
