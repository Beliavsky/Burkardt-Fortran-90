TRIANGLE_TO_XML
  FORTRAN90 version:
  Read a mesh description created by TRIANGLE:
  * "prefix".node, node coordinates.
  * "prefix".ele, element connectivity.
  Write a corresponding XML mesh file.
  * "prefix".xml, element connectivity.

  Size information from TRIANGLE files:
  Spatial dimension M =    2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM =   21
  NODE_ATT_NUM =    0
  NODE_MARKER_NUM =    1
  Number of elements ELEMENT_NUM =   24
  Element order ELEMENT_ORDER =    3
  ELEMENT_ATT_NUM =    0
 
MESH_BASE_ZERO:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  This will be converted to 0-based.

  Created XML file "ell.xml".

TRIANGLE_TO_FEM:
  Normal end of execution.
