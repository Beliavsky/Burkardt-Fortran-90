      STRIPPER <br> Interactive File Modification
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STRIPPER</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out some simple modifications to a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      It even knows a little bit about
      special kinds of files, such as "FORTRAN", "C" or "C++" source codes.
      STRIPPER can delete control characters, capitalize all characters,
      extract the fifth word from every line, write out only columns 10
      through 50, copy only the lines with or without a particular string,
      and a few other tricks.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to use the program, run it and try the "H" (help) command
      first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Historical note and rant: this program was first developed in order to
      deal with a flood of FORTRAN77 program files which had both
      TAB characters (stupid, stupid) and sequence numbers (too distasteful
      to mention any further).
    </p>

    <p>
      Feeding such data to the compiler was
      asking for trouble, particularly if, beforehand, you had made
      any editing changes that caused the continuation character
      (oh my, did I forget to mention <i>those</i> things?) to shift out
      of its position, or the sequence numbers to poke their noses into
      the text fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of these problems would be invisible to
      the programmer, because many editors conspired to hide or
      "process" TAB characters in an indefensibly deceptive way.
      (This <b>ALL</b> goes back to "C" and "int's" and other abbreviations
      and shortcuts that seem to serve the incompetent or lazy typist
      while scattering deadly traps for the innocent).
      ...Anyway, I got tired of replacing TAB's and stripping out
      sequence numbers, so I wrote a program called <b>strip</b>
      to do it for me.  It got renamed <b>stripper</b> because there
      was some UNIX utility that got to the <b>strip</b> name first.
