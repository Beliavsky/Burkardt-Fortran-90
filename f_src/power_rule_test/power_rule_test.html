      <b>power_rule_rest</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls power_rule(), which
      creates a power rule, that is, a multidimensional quadrature rule
      formed as a repeated product of a single one-dimensional quadrature rule.

      As an example, we start with a 1D Clenshaw Curtis rule of order 3:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "cc3_x.txt">
          cc3_x.txt</a>,
          the abscissas of a 1D Clenshaw Curtis rule of order 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "cc3_w.txt">
          cc3_w.txt</a>,
          the weights of a 1D Clenshaw Curtis rule of order 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "cc3_r.txt">
          cc3_r.txt</a>,
          defines the range of the region.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The files which are created include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "power_rule.txt">
          power_rule.txt</a>,
          the output file.

        <li>
          <a href = "power_x.txt">
          power_x.txt</a>,
          the abscissas of the power rule.

        <li>
          <a href = "power_w.txt">
          power_w.txt</a>,

        <li>
          <a href = "power_r.txt">
