POWER_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Create a multidimensional power rule
  as a product of identical 1D integration rules.
 
POWER_RULE: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "cc3_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "cc3_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "cc3_r.txt".
  Spatial dimension =        2
 
  Number of points in 1D rule =        3
 
  Number of points in rule =        9
