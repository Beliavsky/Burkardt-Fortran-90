    <p>
      <b>memory</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      declares and uses a sequence of larger and larger arrays,
      to see what the memory limits are on a given computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program tries an increasing series of values of <b>N</b>, using
      powers of 2, between limits that you set.  At some point, the program
      may ask for more memory than can be provided, and crash.  This is one
      way to find out what the memory ceiling is!  The relevant power of 2
      is likely to be in the 20's:

        <tr>
          <th>Log(N)</th><th>N</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>20</td><td>1,048,576</td>

      Remember that your memory is probably described in terms of bytes,
      but that integers and reals require 4 bytes, and double precision reals
      require 8 bytes.

      Problems with Large Arrays:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The use of very large arrays in a perfectly legal program
      can cause a failure that appears as a "segmentation fault".
    </p>

    <p>
      This might be caused, for instance, by the use of automatic arrays
      in a subprogram.  An automatic array is one whose dimension
      is passed into the subprogram as an argument, but whose memory
      is only created when the subprogram is entered.  Some compilers,
      presumably expecting such arrays to be small, use memory from
      the stack; if the available memory is exceeded, the program crashes.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might be able to make such an error go away by replacing the
      automatic arrays by explicitly allocated arrays.  Their memory
      comes from the heap, which is, typically, a more substantial
      resource.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could allocate the arrays in the calling program.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Unix, you can determine the current stacksize, in kilobytes, by the
      command
      <pre>
        ulimit -S -s
      </pre>
      My system reported the value as "8192".  You can increase this limit to
      a numeric value:
      <pre>
        ulimit -S -s 16384
      </pre>
      or simply ask that it be unlimited using the command:
      <pre>
        ulimit -s unlimited
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, your FORTRAN compiler may have a switch that controls
      the size of the stack, or that changes the method of getting memory
      for automatic arrays.  For the Intel <b>ifort</b> compiler, the
      switch <b>-heap-arrays [n]</b> means that arrays larger than
      <b>n</b> will be assigned memory from the heap rather than the stack.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>memory</b> <i>log_n_min</i> <i>log_n_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      runs the program for sizes <b>N</b> = 2<sup>log_n_min</sup> to
      2<sup>log_n_max</sup>.
