    <p>
      <b>HERMITE_PRODUCT_POLYNOMIAL</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 library which
      defines a Hermite product polynomial (HePP), creating a multivariate 
      polynomial as the product of univariate Hermite polynomials.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hermite polynomials are a polynomial sequence He(i,x), 
      with polynomial I having degree I.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first few Hermite polynomials He(i,x) are
      <pre>
        0: 1
        1: x
        2: x^2 -  1
        3: x^3 -  3 x
        4: x^4 -  6 x^2 + 3
        5: x^5 - 10 x^3 + 15 x
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A Hermite product polynomial may be defined in a space of M dimensions
      by choosing M indices.  To evaluate the polynomial at a point X,
      compute the product of the corresponding Hermite polynomials, with 
      each the I-th polynomial evaluated at the I-th coordinate:
      <pre>
        He((I1,I2,...IM),X) = He(1,X(1)) * He(2,X(2)) * ... * He(M,X(M)).
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Families of polynomials which are formed in this way can have useful
      properties for interpolation, derivable from the properties of the
      1D family.
    </p>

    <p>
      While it is useful to generate a Hermite product polynomial from
      its index set, and it is easy to evaluate it directly, the sum of
      two Hermite product polynomials cannot be reduced to a single
      Hermite product polynomial.  Thus, it may be useful to generate
      the Hermite product polynomial from its indices, but then to
      convert it to a standard polynomial form.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The representation of arbitrary multivariate polynomials can be
      complicated.  In this library, we have chosen a representation involving
      the spatial dimension M, and three pieces of data, O, C and E.
      <ul>
        <li>
          O is the number of terms in the polynomial.
        </li>
        <li>
          C() is a real vector of length O, containing the coefficients of each term.
        </li>
        <li>
          E() is an integer vector of length O, which defines the index (the
          exponents of X(1) through X(M)) of each term.  
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The exponent indexing is done in a natural way, suggested by the
      following indexing for the case M = 2:
      <pre>
        1: x^0 y^0  
        2: x^0 y^1
        3: x^1 y^0
        4: x^0 y^2
        5: x^1 y^1
        6; x^2 y^0
        7: x^0 y^3
        8: x^1 y^2
        9: x^2 y^1
       10: x^3 y^0
       ...
      </pre>
    </p>
