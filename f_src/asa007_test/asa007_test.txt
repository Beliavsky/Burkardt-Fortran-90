ASA007_TEST:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test ASA007.
 
TEST01:
  SYMINV computes the inverse of a positive
  definite symmetric matrix.
  A compressed storage format is used.
 
  Here we look at the matrix A which is
  N+1 on the diagonal and
  N   on the off diagonals.

TEST01:
  SYMINV computes the inverse of a positive
  definite symmetric matrix.
  A compressed storage format is used.
 
  Here we look at the Hilbert matrix
  A(I,J) = 1/(I+J-1).
 
  For this particular matrix, we expect the
  errors to grow rapidly.
