BISECTION_INTEGER_TEST
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the BISECTION_INTEGER library.
 
TEST01
  BISECTION_INTEGER attempts to locate an integer root C
  of an equation F(C) = 0.
  The user supplies a change of sign interval [A,B].
  The function considered here has two real roots
  as well as an integer root, so the algorithm can
  fail depending on how the change of sign interval is chosen.
 
  The initial change of sign interval is:
  F(       4) =      -42
  F(     100) =  3456630
 
  An exact root was found at C =       10
 
  The initial change of sign interval is:
  F(     -10) =   -11340
  F(      15) =     3335
 
  An exact root was NOT found.
  The change of sign interval is now:
  F(       0) =      -70
  F(       1) =       45
 
BISECTION_INTEGER_TEST
  Normal end of execution.
