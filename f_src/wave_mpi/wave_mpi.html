      WAVE_MPI <br> Parallel Solution of the 1D Wave Equation using MPI
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>WAVE_MPI</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      solves the 1D wave equation in parallel, using MPI.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program solves the 1D wave equation of the form:
      <pre>
        Utt = c^2 Uxx
      </pre>
      over the spatial interval [X1,X2] and time interval [T1,T2],
      with initial conditions:
      <pre>
        U(X,T1)  = U_T1(X),
        Ut(X,T1) = UT_T1(X),
      </pre>
      and boundary conditions of Dirichlet type:
      <pre>
        U(X1,T) = U_X1(T),<br>
        U(X2,T) = U_X2(T).
      </pre>
      The value <b>C</b> represents the propagation speed of waves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses the finite difference method, and marches
      forward in time, solving for all the values of U at the next
      time step by using the values known at the previous two time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Central differences may be used to approximate both the time
      and space derivatives in the original differential equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, assuming we have available the approximated values of U
      at the current and previous times, we may write a discretized
      version of the wave equation as follows:
      <pre>
        Uxx(X,T) = ( U(X+dX,T   ) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X-dX,T,  ) ) / dX^2
        Utt(X,T) = ( U(X,   T+dT) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X,   T-dt) ) / dT^2
      </pre>
      If we multiply the first term by C^2 and solve for the single
      unknown value U(X,T+dt), we have:
      <pre>
        U(X,T+dT) =        (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X+dX,T)
                    +  2 * ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X,   T)
                    +      (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X-dX,T)
                    -                                  U(X,   T-dT)
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT, except for FIRST step!)
    </p>

    <p>
      However, on the very first step, we only have the values of U
      for the initial time, but not for the previous time step.
      In that case, we use the initial condition information for dUdT
      which can be approximated by a central difference that involves
      U(X,T+dT) and U(X,T-dT):
      <pre>
        dU/dT(X,T) = ( U(X,T+dT) - U(X,T-dT) ) / ( 2 * dT )
      </pre>
      and so we can estimate U(X,T-dT) as
      <pre>
        U(X,T-dT) = U(X,T+dT) - 2 * dT * dU/dT(X,T)
      </pre>
      If we replace the "missing" value of U(X,T-dT) by the known values
      on the right hand side, we now have U(X,T+dT) on both sides of the
      equation, so we have to rearrange to get the formula we use
      for just the first time step:
      <pre>
        U(X,T+dT) =   1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X+dX,T)
                    +       ( 1 - C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X,   T)
                    + 1/2 * (     C^2 * dT^2 / dX^2 ) * U(X-dX,T)
                    +  dT *                         dU/dT(X,   T   )
      </pre>
      (Equation to advance from time T to time T+dT for FIRST step.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear now that the quantity ALPHA = C * dT / dX will affect
      the stability of the calculation.  If it is greater than 1, then
      the middle coefficient (1-C^2 dT^2 / dX^2) is negative, and the
      sum of the magnitudes of the three coefficients becomes unbounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      We wish to use MPI in order to accelerate this computation.  We use the
      method of domain decomposition - that is, we assume we have P MPI processes,
      we divide the original interval into P subintervals, and we expect
      each process to update the data associated with its subinterval.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, to compute the estimated solution U(X,T+dT) at the next time
      step requires information about U(X-dX,T) and U(X+dX,T).  When process
      ID tries to make these estimates, it will need one value from process
      ID-1, and one from process ID+1, before it can make all the updates.
      MPI allows the processes to communicate this information using messages.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the complete calculation, we wish to print a table of the
      solution at the final time.  To do this in an organized fashion, we want
      each process to send its final result to the master process (with ID = 0).
      Once all the data has been collected, the master process prints it.
