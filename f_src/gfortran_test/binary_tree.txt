BINARY_TREE:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Demonstrate how pointers can be used to define
  and manipulate a binary tree.
 
TEST01
  Create, one at a time, a sequence of integers.
  As each integer is created, insert it into a sorted
  binary tree.  Print the binary tree at the end.
 
  Initial data generation:
 
         1       953
         2       895
         3       220
         4       492

         9       988
        10       115
 
  Contents of sorted binary tree:
 
         7        10
