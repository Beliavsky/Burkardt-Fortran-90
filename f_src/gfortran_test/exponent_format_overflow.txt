EXPONENT_FORMAT_OVERFLOW:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
TEST01
  Real numbers can have exponents greater than 99.
 
  It is unsettling to discover that there is a
  common FLAW in certain output formats, which means
  that the printing of real numbers with exponents
  of magnitude more than 99 is handled poorly.
 
  The "E" marker, used to indicate scientific notation,
  is simply suppressed, as though to make room for
  the leading digit of the exponent.
 
  But this inconsistency can be deadly.  In particular,
  if you write out such data, it CANNOT be read back in
  properly!  (THAT example is easy to write, but I will
  do that later.)
 
  Define some big numbers:
 
  X1 = huge ( X1 )
  X2 = 0.99D+00 * X1
  X3 = X1 / 100.0D+00
  X4 = 1.0D+101.
 
  Define some small numbers:
 
  X5 = tiny ( X5 )
  X6 = 1.01D+00 * X5
  X7 = X5 * 100.0D+00
  X8 = 1.0D-101.
 
  Define some comparison numbers:
 
  X9  = 1.0D+98
  X10 = 1.0D-98
  X11 = 123456789.0
  X12 = 0.123456789
 
  Print with a WRITE(*,*) format:
  This seems to work OK:

   X8 =    1.0000000000000001E-101
   X9 =    1.0000000000000000E+098
   X10 =    9.9999999999999994E-099
   X11 =    123456789.00000000
