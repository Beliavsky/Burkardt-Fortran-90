CONSTANT_TYPE
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Demonstrate that constants have a type.
 
  EXAMPLE 1:
 
  Print the value of
    1.0203040506070809 - 1.020304050607
 
     1.0203040506070809 - 1.020304050607 =    0.00000000    
 
  If single precision is the default, this will be 0.
 
  EXAMPLE 2:
  A constant has a type.
  If you do not specify one, one will be provided.
  If we assign a 32 decimal constant to a single,
  double, and quadruple precision variable,
  IN EVERY CASE, only the first 8 decimals will be used,
  because we did not set the type of the constant:
 
    a = 1.020304050607080910111213141516
    b = 1.020304050607080910111213141516
    c = 1.020304050607080910111213141516
 
   A =    1.02030408    
   B =    1.0203040838241577     
   C =    1.02030408382415771484375000000000000      
 
  EXAMPLE 3:
  Use an exponent marker of "E", "D" or "Q" to indicate
  that your constant is single, double or quadruple
  precision.  If we repeat the previous test, we now see
  the appropriate number of decimals are copied.
 
    a = 1.020304050607080910111213141516E+00
    b = 1.020304050607080910111213141516D+00
    c = 1.020304050607080910111213141516Q+00
 
   A =    1.02030408    
   B =    1.0203040506070808     
   C =    1.02030405060708091011121314151600000      
 
CONSTANT_TYPE
  Normal end of execution.
