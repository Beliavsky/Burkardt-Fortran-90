LINKED_LIST:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Demonstrate how pointers can be used to define
  and manipulate a linked list.
 
TEST01
  Create, one at a time, a sequence of integers.
  As each integer is created, insert it into a sorted
  list.  Print the list at the end.
 
  We carry out this task using a linked list.
 
  Initial data generation:
 
         1       836
         2       123
         3       329
         4       936
         5       170

         8       433
         9       518
        10       335
 
  Contents of sorted linked list:
 
         1         2       123
         2         5       170
