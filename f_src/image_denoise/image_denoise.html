      IMAGE_DENOISE <br> Remove Noise from an Image
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>IMAGE_DENOISE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      uses the median filter to try to remove noise from an image.
    </p>

    <p>
      A gray scale image can be represented using a 2D array of nonnegative 
      integers over some range 0 to GMAX.
      The value 0 indicates black, and GMAX white.  Intermediate values
      represent shades of gray in a natural way.  Note, however, that
      the eye has a nonlinear response to intensity, so that the value
      GMAX/2 will not be perceived as halfway between 0 and GMAX.  That
      is a separate issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      A color image can be represented using a set of three 2D arrays,
      which can be thought of as R, G, and B, and which represent the
      intensity of the red, green and blue signals that combine to
      form the color image.  A common maximum value is assumed, RGBMAX.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ASCII PGM and PPM formats are a convenient, if somewhat inefficient,
      way to store such images.  These ASCII formats are easy to read and
      write from a program.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example considered here, a good image is damaged by the addition of
      "salt and pepper" noise; that is, a scattering of individual pixels have
      been randomly reset to the lowest or highest possible values.  In a
      gray scale picture, such noise looks as though salt and pepper were
      added to the picture.
    </p>

    <p>
      <image src = "balloons_noisy.png" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=240
      ALT="A Noisy Image">
    </p>

    <p>
      Since an image is fairly "smooth", each good pixel should actually be
      fairly close to the values of good pixels nearby, while this will not
      be true for the salt and pepper pixels.  So one way to make the noise
      go away, at the cost of some minor blurring, is to replace each pixel
      by the median value of itself and its neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are sophisticated programs for applying the filters to a noisy
      image,  with the user allowed to specify the shape of a rectangular neighborhood
      about each pixel.  However, in this example, we go through some of
      the lower level details "by hand", applying simple versions of the median
      filter, in which each pixel is replaced by the median of nearby values.
