JACOBI_EXACTNESS
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Jacobi
  quadrature rule by integrating weighted 
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.
 
JACOBI_EXACTNESS: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "jac_o2_a0.5_b1.5_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =        5
  Exponent of (1-x), ALPHA =   0.500000    
  Exponent of (1+x), BETA  =    1.50000    
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        2
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Jacobi rule
  ORDER =        2
  ALPHA =   0.500000    
  BETA  =    1.50000    
 
  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) (1-x)^alpha (1+x)^beta f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).
 
  Weights W:
 
  w( 1) =   0.6369718619318372    
  w( 2) =   0.9338244648627008    
 
  Abscissas X:
 
  x( 1) =  -0.2742918851774317    
  x( 2) =   0.6076252185107651    
 
  Region R:
 
  r( 1) =   -1.000000000000000    
  r( 2) =    1.000000000000000    
 
  A Gauss-Jacobi rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        3
