      <b>heated_plate_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls heated_plate(), which
      solves the steady state heat equation in a 2D
      rectangular region, and is intended as
      a starting point for implementing a parallel version.

      The program has a built in grid of M = 500, N = 500.  It is only necessary to
      alter these definitions and recompile in order to run the problem on a different
      grid.  Here are the output files and solution files from two runs.
