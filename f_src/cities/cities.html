    <p>
      <b>CITIES</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      works with problems involving intercity distances.
    </p>

    <p>
      Such problems include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          traveling salesman problems (connected path through every city);
        </li>
        <li>
          K-means calculations (find M spots that minimize total of the
          distance from each city to its nearest spot);
        </li>
        <li>
          K-medians calculations (make M of the cities "special", to minimize
          the total distance from each city to its nearest special city);
        </li>
        <li>
          Weighted K-means or K-medians (let the population of each city
          be used as a weight, which makes some cities more important);
        </li>
        <li>
          Minimal spanning trees (construct the shortest highway
          system that connects all the cities, using only straight paths
          from one city to another (ignore the possibility that two roads
          could cross, or that a Y-shaped connector between three cities
          might be cheaper);
        </li>
        <li>
          Voronoi diagrams (assign each spot of land to the nearest city,
          making "provinces");
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
