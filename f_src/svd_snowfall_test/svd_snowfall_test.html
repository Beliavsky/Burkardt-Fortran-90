      <b>svd_snowfall_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls svd_snowfall(), which
      demonstrates the use of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
      to analyze a set of historical snowfall data,
      with plots created by GNUPLOT.

      The snowfall data itself must be read into the program from a file:

          the snowfall data.

      The second test function writes "command" and "data" files that can be used

      The fourth test function writes "command" and "data" files that can be used
      by gnuplot to create plots of the first 6 U modes, which form a basis
      for average snowfall as a function of the month.

      The fifth test function writes "command" and "data" files that can be used
      by gnuplot to create plots of the first 6 V modes, which form a basis
      for total yearly snowfall behavior as a function of the year.
