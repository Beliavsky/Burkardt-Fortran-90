      SCHEDULE_OPENMP <br> Scheduling Loop Iterations in OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SCHEDULE_OPENMP</b> 
      is a FORTRAN90 code which
      demonstrates the use of default, static and dynamic scheduling
      of loop iterations in OpenMP.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default, when OpenMP, executing with T threads, encounters a 
      parallel loop of N iterations, it assigns the first N/T iterations
      to thread 0, the second chunk of N/T iterations to thread 1 and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes this simple, default "scheduling" of the iterations is
      not ideal.  It may be the case that iterations of high index 
      represent more work.  In that case, the lower numbered threads
      will finish early and have nothing to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <b>static</b> schedule clause modifies the iteration assignment
      procedure by essentially "dealing out" the iterations.  The clause
      <b>schedule(static,5)</b>, for instance, indicates that the N iterations
      are to be dealt out in groups of 5, until all are assigned.  This
      schedule might divide up the work more evenly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In more complicated situations, where the work involved with each
      iteration can vary dramatically, the <b>dynamic</b> schedule clause
      allows the user to parcel out a small number of iterations initially,
      and then to wait until a thread is finished that work, at which
      point it is given another group of iterations.  The format of this
      clause is <b>schedule(dynamic,7)</b> where here 7 iterations are
      assigned to each thread initially, and the remaining work is assigned,
      7 iterations at a time, to threads that finish what they have already
      been assigned.
    </p>

      Example:
    </h3>

    <p>
      For simplicity, we assume that we have a loop of 16 iterations,
      which has been parallelized by OpenMP, and that we are about
      to execute that loop using 2 threads.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <b>default scheduling</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          thread 1 is assigned to do iterations 1 to 8;
        </li>
        <li>
          thread 2 is assigned to do iterations 9 to 16.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In <b>static scheduling</b>, using a "chunksize" of 4:
      <ul>
        <li>
          thread 1 is assigned to do iterations 1 to 4 and 9 to 12.
        </li>
        <li>
          thread 2 is assigned to do iterations 5 to 8 and 13 to 16.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In <b>dynamic scheduling</b>, using a "chunksize" of 3:
      <ul>
        <li>
          thread 1 is assigned to do iterations 1 to 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          thread 2 is assigned to do iterations 4 to 6.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The next chunk is iterations 7 to 9, and will be assigned to
      whichever thread finishes its current work first, and so on
      until all work is completed.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      In the BASH shell, the program could be run with 2 threads using the commands:
      <pre>
        export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
        ./schedule_openmp
      </pre>
