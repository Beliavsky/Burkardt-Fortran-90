FEM1D_PROJECT
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Read files defining a sampling of a function of 1 argument.
  Read files defining a finite element mesh.
  Project the sample data onto the mesh, and
  write a file of FEM coefficient values.
 
  Sample node spatial dimension is        1
  Sample node number is                  11
 
  Sample value dimension is               3
  Sample value number is                 11
 
  The FEM node dimension is               1
  The FEM node number is                  6
  The FEM element order is                2
  The FEM element number is               5
 
  FEM value data written to "fem_powers_values.txt".
