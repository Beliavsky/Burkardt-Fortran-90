      SORT_RC <br> Sort Using Reverse Communication
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SORT_RC</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can sort a list of any kind of objects,
      using reverse communication (RC).
    </p>

    <p>
      The program works by repeatedly asking the user to compare two
      items on the list.  The user is free to carry out the comparison
      in the calling program, in any desired way.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical usage, to sort an array of 100 items, might look 
      something like this:
      <pre>
        n = 100
        indx = 0   -- Indicates the beginning of a sort
 
        begin loop

          sort_rc ( n, indx, i, j, isgn )

          if ( indx < 0 )   (Compare items I and J)

            if ( a(i) <= a(j) )
              isgn = -1
            else
              isgn = +1
 
           else if ( 0 < indx )  (Swap items I and J)
  
             k    = a(i)
             a(i) = a(j)
             a(j) = k
 
           else
 
             exit loop

        end loop
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The original version of sort_rc() requires the use of several variables
      declared internally to the function, whose values must be preserved 
      between calls.  The conventions for such computations vary from language
      to language; moreover, this kind of approach means that a single copy of
      the function cannot handle multiple requests for computation that might
      arise, especially in parallel computations.  For that reason, a revised 
      function, called sort_safe_rc(), is available, which does not rely on
      hidden internal variables and may safely be used to manage multiple
      simultaneous sorts.
