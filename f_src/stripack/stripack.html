      STRIPACK <br> Delaunay Triangulation on a Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>STRIPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out some computational geometry tasks on the unit sphere in 3D,
      by Robert Renka.
    </p>

    <p>
      STRIPACK can compute the Delaunay triangulation or the
      Voronoi diagram of a set of points on the unit sphere. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      STRIPACK can make a PostScript plot
      of the Delaunay triangulation or the Voronoi diagram from a given 
      point of view.
    </p>

    <p>
      STRIPACK is a generalization of Robert Renka's code
      TRIPACK, which computes
      Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams for a set of points
      in the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      STRIPACK is a FORTRAN90 "translation" of the original
      FORTRAN77 code written by Robert Renka and published in the
      ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      STRIPACK is ACM TOMS Algorithm 772.  The text of the
      original FORTRAN77 version is available online
      through ACM:
              <a href = "http://www.acm.org/pubs/calgo/">

    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay 
      triangulation of points on a sphere by computing their convex hull.  
      If the sphere is the unit sphere at the origin, the facet normals are 
      the Voronoi vertices.
