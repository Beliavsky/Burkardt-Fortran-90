      <b>subset_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls subset() to
      enumerate, generate, randomize, rank and unrank combinatorial objects
      including combinations, compositions, Gray codes, index sets, partitions, 
      permutations, polynomials, subsets, and Young tables.  Backtracking 
      routines are included to solve some combinatorial problems.  Some routines
      for continued fractions are included.
