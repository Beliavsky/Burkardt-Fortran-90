      LAU_NP <br> Heuristics for NP problems
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAU_NP</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements heuristic algorithms for certain "hard" problems,
      by Hang Tong Lau.
    </p>

    <p>
      These problems are hard in the sense that, as the problem size N
      increases, the amount of work required to compute a solution grows
      exponentially.
    </p>

    <p>
      The classic example of this is the "traveling salesman problem",
      which seeks the shortest roundtrip that visits each location exactly
      once.  The obvious method of solution, to compute the length of every
      possible path, is not much worse than the best known method of
      solution, in terms of the amount of computing required to find the
      exact answer.  However, there are heuristic methods that can find a
      "reasonable" approximation to the answer for most problems, in a
      much shorter amount of time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problems considered include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the integer linear programming problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the K-center problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the K-median problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the 0-1 knapsack problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the multiple knapsack problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the graph matching problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the graph partitioning problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the minimal Steiner tree problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          the traveling salesman problem;
        </li>
      </ul>
