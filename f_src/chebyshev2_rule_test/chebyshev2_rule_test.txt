CHEBYSHEV2_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Gauss-Chebyshev type 2 rule for
 
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x)  sqrt ( ( x - A ) * ( B - x ) ) dx
 
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME.
 
  ORDER is the number of points.
 
  A is the left endpoint.
 
  B is the right endpoint.
 
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
 
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =        5
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "cheby2_o5".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "cheby2_o5".
 
  Weight file will be   "cheby2_o5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "cheby2_o5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "cheby2_o5_r.txt".
 
CHEBYSHEV2_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
