DIJKSTRA_OPENMP:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Use Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the minimum
  distance from node 1 to each node in a graph,
  given the distances between each pair of nodes.
 
  Although a very small example is considered, we
  demonstrate the use of OpenMP directives for
  parallel execution.
