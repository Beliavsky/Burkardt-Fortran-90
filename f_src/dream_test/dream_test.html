      DREAM <br> Markov Chain Monte Carlo acceleration by Differential Evolution
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DREAM</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements the DREAM algorithm for accelerating 
      Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence using differential evolution,
      by Guannan Zhang.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires user input in the form of five FORTRAN90
      subroutines:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>problem_size()</i>, defines the sizes of problem parameters;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>problem_value()</i>, defines the value of problem parameters;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prior_density()</i>, evaluates the prior distribution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prior_sample()</i>, samples the prior distribution;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>sample_likelihood()</i>, evaluates the log likelihood function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Examples of such user input are listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires access to a compiled version of the
      pdflib() code, which can evaluate a variety of Probability
      Density Functions (PDF's) and produce samples from them.
      The user may wish to invoke this code when constructing
      some of the user functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      DREAM requires access to a compiled version of the
      rnglib code, in order to generate random numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      An older implementation of the DREAM algorithm is available
      as DREAM1; it requires a user main code and two input files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DREAM code was originally developed by Guannan Zhang, of
      Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL); it has been incorporated into 
      the DAKOTA package of Sandia National Laboratory, and forms
      part of the ORNL package known as TASMANIAN.

      <b>PROBLEM1</b> is based on the first example in the Vrugt reference.
      The Vrugt version involves 100 variables, with a multidimensional
      normal distribution with specified mean vector and covariance matrix.
      So far, I have simply set up the user routines, with just 5 variables,
      and created a small stand-alone main code to test it.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1.f90">problem1.f90</a>,
          is a user written file, containing the 5 functions required
          to define the problem data, as well as other functions to
          set the covariance for problem 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_main.f90">problem1_main.f90</a>,
          a stand-alone main code that calls the user functions
          to make some simple tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem1_main.txt">problem1_main.txt</a>,
          the output file from the standalone main code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>PROBLEM2</b> is based on the second example in the Vrugt reference.
      The Vrugt version involves 10 variables, with a "twisted" Gaussian
      density function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "problem2.f90">problem2.f90</a>,
          is a user written file, containing the 5 functions required
          to define problem 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
