      TEST_MESH <br> Sample 2D Meshes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_MESH</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines a few
      simple triangular meshes of 2D regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alan George and Joseph Liu generated the original set of 9 meshes.
      They used them to generate refined meshes, made by subdividing
      every triangle the same number of times.  Then the node-connectivity
      matrix of the refined mesh was used to define a positive definite
      symmetric sparse matrix problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, the meshes can be of interest for other reasons.
      For instance, it is possible to output the mesh information
      as a <b>poly</b> file.  This format can be input to the
      SHOWME program for display, or to
      TRIANGLE.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is set up to allow a user to easily access a particular
      mesh by specifying its number, or to access all the examples,
      by going through the master routines whose names begin with the
      prefix <b>MESH00_</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user can easily handle problems of various size by first calling
      the routines that give the sizes of various arrays, then using
      the FORTRAN90 <b>ALLOCATE</b> command to set up enough space for the
      array, and then calling the library routine that fills up the array
      with information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The meshes include:
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Square, 4 nodes, 2 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Graded L, 22 nodes, 30 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Plus-Shaped Domain, 28 nodes, 26 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The H-Shaped Domain, 40 nodes, 38 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Hollow Square (Small Hole), 12 nodes, 12 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Hollow Square (Large Hole), 32 nodes, 32 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 3-Hole Problem, 44 nodes, 56 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The 6-Hole Problem, 46 nodes, 56 elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Pinched Hole Problem, 8 nodes, 7 elements.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
