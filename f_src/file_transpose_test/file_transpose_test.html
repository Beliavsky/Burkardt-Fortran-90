      <b>file_transpose_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls file_transpose(), which
      creates a "transposed" copy of a file, in which, essentially, the I-th
      word of the J-th line becomes the J-th word of the I-th line.

      a FORTRAN90 code which

      <b>PIGS</b> is a simple demonstration of the code.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "pigs.txt">pigs.txt</a>,
          a simple file of 3 lines of 4 words, 4 words, and 3 words respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "pigs_transposed.txt">pigs_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file, containing 4 lines of 3 words, 3 words, 3 words and 2 words
          respectively.  Because the lines are almost all the same length, it's not hard
          to read the story this way.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>STORY</b> suggests that the code is not so useful when working with
      ragged text.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "story.txt">story.txt</a>,
          a file containing blank lines and lines of greatly varying numbers of words.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "story_transposed.txt">story_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file.  Because the input text was "ragged", it's not easy to
          read the text now, nor would it be easy to reconstruct the original file!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX</b> illustrates how a numeric table or matrix can be transposed.
      In fact, this is the application for which the FILE_TRANSPOSE code was written.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href = "matrix.txt">matrix.txt</a>,
          a file containing 30 lines, each containing 10 numeric values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href = "matrix_transposed.txt">matrix_transposed.txt</a>,
          the transposed file, with 10 lines of 30 values.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
