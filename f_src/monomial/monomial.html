    <p>
      <b>MONOMIAL</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      enumerates, lists, ranks, unranks and randomizes multivariate monomials 
      in a space of D dimensions, with total degree less than N,
      equal to N, or lying within a given range.
    </p>

    <p>
      A (univariate) monomial in 1 variable x is simply any (nonnegative integer) power of x:
      <pre>
        1, x, x^2, x^3, ...
      </pre>
      The exponent of x is termed the degree of the monomial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since any polynomial p(x) can be written as
      <pre>
        p(x) = c(0) * x^0 + c(1) * x^1 + c(2) * x^2 + ... + c(n) * x^n
      </pre>
      we may regard the monomials as a natural basis for the space of 
      polynomials, in which case the coefficients may be regarded as
      the coordinates of the polynomial.
    </p>

    <p>
      A (multivariate) monomial in D variables x(1), x(2), ..., x(d) is a product of the
      form
      <pre>
        x(1)^e(1) * x(2)^e(2) * ... * x(d)^e(d)
      </pre>
      where e(1) through e(d) are nonnegative integers.  The sum of the
      exponents is termed the degree of the monomial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any polynomial in D variables can be written as a linear
      combination of monomials in D variables.  The "total degree" of the
      polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the monomials that it
      comprises.  For instance, a polynomial in D = 2 variables of total
      degree 3 might have the form:
      <pre>
        p(x,y) = c(0,0) x^0 y^0
               + c(1,0) x^1 y^0 + c(0,1) x^0 y^1 
               + c(2,0) x^2 y^0 + c(1,1) x^1 y^1 + c(0,2) x^0 y^2
               + c(3,0) x^3 y^0 + c(2,1) x^2 y^1 + c(1,2) x^1 y^2 + c(0,3) x^0 y^3
      </pre>
      The monomials in D variables can be regarded as 
      a natural basis for the polynomials in D variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      For multidimensional polynomials, a number of orderings are possible.
      Two common orderings are "grlex" (graded lexicographic) and
      "grevlex" (graded reverse lexicographic).  Once an ordering is imposed, 
      each monomial in D variables has a rank, and it is possible to ask (and answer!) the
      following questions:
      <p>
        <li>
          How many monomials are there in D dimensions, of degree N, or
          up to and including degree N, or between degrees N1 and N2?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can you list in rank order the monomials in D dimensions, of degree N, or
          up to and including degree N, or between degrees N1 and N2?
        </li>
        <li>
          Given a monomial in D dimensions, can you determine the rank
          it  holds in the list of all such monomials?
        </li>
        <li>
          Given a rank, can you determine the monomial in D dimensions
          that occupies that position in the list of all such monomials?
        </li>
        <li>
          Can you select at random a monomial in D dimensions from the set
          of all such monomials of degree up to N?
        </li>
      </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      As mentioned, two common orderings for monomials are "grlex" (graded lexicographic) and
      "grevlex" (graded reverse lexicographic).
      The word "graded" in both names indicates that, for both orderings,
      one monomial is "less" than another if its total degree is less.
      Thus, for both orderings, xyz^2 is less than y^5 because a monomial of
      degree 4 is less than a monomial of degree 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what happens when we compare two monomials of the same degree?
      For the lexicographic ordering, one monomial is less than another if its
      vector of exponents is lexicographically less.  Given two vectors
      v1=(x1,y1,z1) and v2=(x2,y2,z2), v1 is less than v2 if
      <ul>
        <li>
          x1 is less than x2;
        </li>
        <li>
          or x1 = x2, but y1 is less than y2;
        </li>
        <li>
          or x1 = x2, and y1 = y2, but z1 is less than z2;
        </li>
      </ul>
      (For a graded ordering, the third case can't occur, since we have
      assumed the two monomials have the same degree, and hence the
      exponents have the same sum.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, for the grlex ordering, we first order by degree, and then
      for two monomials of the same degree, we use the lexicographic ordering.
      Here is how the grlex ordering would arrange monomials in D=3 dimensions.

    <p>
      For the reverse lexicographic ordering, given two vectors,
      v1=(x1,y1,z1) and v2=(x2,y2,z2), v1 is less than v2 if:
      <ul>
        <li>
          z1 is greater than z2;
        </li>
        <li>
          or z1 = z2 but y1 is greater than y2;
        </li>
        <li>
          or z1 = z2, and y1 = y2, but x1 is greater than x2. 
        </li>
      </ul> 
      (For a graded ordering, the third case can't occur, since we have
      assumed the two monomials have the same degree, and hence the
      exponents have the same sum.)

      Thus, for the grevlex ordering, we first order by degree, and then
      for two monomials of the same degree, we use the reverse lexicographic ordering.
      Here is how the grevlex ordering would arrange monomials in D=3 dimensions.
