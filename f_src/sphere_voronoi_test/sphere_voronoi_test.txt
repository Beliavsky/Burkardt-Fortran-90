SPHERE_VORONOI
  FORTRAN90 version
  Given a set of XYZ points on the sphere,
  compute the Voronoi diagram.
 
XYZ_READ:
  Read       10 text lines from gen_00010.xyz
  Read       10 sets of (X,Y,Z) coordinates.
 
POLY_COUNT_MAX
  Highest order polygon is        5
 
POLY_COUNT
  Number of polygons of each shape.
 
  Faces =          10
  Vertices =       16
  Edges =          24
 
  Check Euler's formula:
  F+V-E-2 =         0
 
     Sides    Number
 
         4         2
         5         8
 
VRPLOT created the Voronoi plot file: "gen_00010.eps".
 
VR_TO_XYZF:
  Wrote the Voronoi XYZ file "gen_00010.voronoi.xyz".
 
VR_TO_XYZF:
  Wrote the Voronoi XYZF file "gen_00010.voronoi.xyzf".
 
SPHERE_VORONOI
  Normal end of execution.
