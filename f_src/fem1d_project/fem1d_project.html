    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM1D_PROJECT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      computes the projection of data onto a given 1D finite element mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      This procedure can be used to determine the least squares approximant to
      data (actually, to the piecewise linear interpolant of that data) or to
      determine the finite element coefficients appropriate when recomputing
      a finite element solution from a fine mesh to a coarse mesh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sample data is given simply as two files, one containing the points,
      the other, the corresponding data values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user must also supply two files defining the finite element mesh,
      containing the points, and the pairs of points that form the elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program takes the sample data, projects it onto the finite element mesh,
      and determines a file of finite element coefficients that represent the
      projection of the data onto the finite element space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current version of the program can only handle finite element
      meshes which are made of piecewise linear basis functions.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>sample_prefix</i><b>_nodes.txt</b>,  the node coordinates.

        </li>

        <li>
          <i>fem_prefix</i><b>_values.txt</b>,   created by the program, and contains
          the projections of the data values onto the finite element space, that is,
          these may be regarded as coefficients of finite element functions
          representing the projections of the data.
