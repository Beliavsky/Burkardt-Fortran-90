CYCLE_FLOYD_TEST
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the CYCLE_FLOYD library.
 
TEST01
  Test CYCLE_FLOYD on F1().
  f1(0) = 6.
  f1(1) = 6.
  f1(2) = 0.
  f1(3) = 1.
  f1(4) = 4.
  f1(5) = 3.
  f1(6) = 3.
  f1(7) = 4.
  f1(8) = 0.
 
  Starting argument X0 =   2
 
  Reported cycle length is   3
  Expected value is 3
 
  Reported distance to first cycle element is   2
  Expected value is 2
 
TEST02
  Test CYCLE_FLOYD for F2().
  f2(i) = mod ( 22 * i + 1, 72 ).
 
  Starting argument X0 =   0
 
  Reported cycle length is   9
  Expected value is 9
 
  Reported distance to first cycle element is   3
  Expected value is 3
 
TEST03
  Test CYCLE_FLOYD for F3().
  f3(i) = mod ( 123 * i + 456, 100000 ).
 
  Starting argument X0 = 789
 
  Reported cycle length is    50000
  Expected value is 50000
 
  Reported distance to first cycle element is        0
  Expected value is 0
 
TEST04
  Test CYCLE_FLOYD for F4().
  f4(i) = mod ( 31421 * i + 6927, 65536 ).
 
  Starting argument X0 =   1
 
  Reported cycle length is    65536
  Expected value is 65536
 
  Reported distance to first cycle element is        0
  Expected value is 0
 
TEST05

  f5(i) = mod ( 16383 * i + 1, 65536 ).
 
  Starting argument X0 =   1
 
  Reported cycle length is        8
  Expected value is 8
 
  Reported distance to first cycle element is        0
  Expected value is 0
