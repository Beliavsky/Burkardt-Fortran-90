subroutine bisection_integer ( f, a, b, c, fc )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! BISECTION_INTEGER seeks an integer root using bisection.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    A function F(X) confined to integer arguments is given, with an
!    interval [A,B] over which F changes sign.  An integer C is sought
!    such that A <= C <= B and F(C) = 0.
!
!    Because we are restricted to integer arguments, it may the case that
!    there is no such C.
!
!    This routine proceeds by a form of bisection, in which the enclosing
!    interval is restricted to be defined by integer values.
!
!    If the user has given a true change of sign interval [A,B], and if,
!    in the interval, there is a single integer value C for which F(C) = 0,
!    with the additional restrictions that F(C-1) and F(C+1) are of opposite
!    signs, then this procedure should locate and return C.
!
!    In particular, if the function F is monotone, and there is an integer
!    solution C in the interval, then this procedure will find it.
!
!    However, in general, even if there is an integer C in the interval,
!    such that F(C) = 0, this procedure may be unable to find it, particularly
!    if there are also nonintegral solutions within the same interval.
!
!    While any integer function can be used with this program, the bisection
!    approach is most useful if the integer function is monotone, or
!    varies slowly, or can be regarded as the restriction to integer arguments
!    of a continuous (and smoothly varying) function of a real argument.
!    In such cases, knowing that F is negative at A and positive at B
!    suggests that F generally increases from A to B, and might attain 
!    the value 0 at some intermediate argument C.

!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, external integer ( kind = 4 ) F, the name of a user-supplied 
!    procedure that evaluates the function, of the form
!      function f ( c )
!      integer ( kind = 4 ) c, f
!
!   Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) A, B, two arguments that define a change of
!   sign interval for F.  In other words, F(A) and F(B) must be of opposite
!   sign.
!
!   Output, integer ( kind = 4 ) C, FC, the candidate for the root, as 
!   determined by the program, and its function value.  If FC is not zero,
!   then the procedure did not find a root in the interval, and C is only
!   an "approximate" root.
