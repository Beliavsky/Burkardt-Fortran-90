      <b>f90_stop_test</b>,
      FORTRAN90 codes which
      demonstrates how a FORTRAN90 code can return a code status value.
    </p>

    <p>
      C and C++ codes can return an integer value signalling the status
      of the code's execution.  By convention, a return value of 0 indicates
      that the code executed successfully, while a nonzero value indicates
      some kind of error.
    </p>

    <p>
      The return value of such a code can be retrieved and used to make
      decisions.  In particular, if the execution of the code is part of
      a script, then the failure of the code can be detected, and the
      script can terminate gracefully.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an example in the BASH shell, we might have a script that reads:
      <pre>
        ./prog
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Errors while running prog."
          exit
        fi
      </pre>
      Here, $? is a BASH symbol that returns the most recent code status
      value, and the script exits if that value is not zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      FORTRAN has always had the option to include a constant integer value 
      as part of the STOP statement.  At least some FORTRAN compilers can
      treat this value as a  code status value that is returned to the
      calling environment, and hence can signal whether certain errors
      have occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, we show a simple example in which the code is guaranteed
      to fail, and in that case will return the arbitrary but nonzero value 13.
