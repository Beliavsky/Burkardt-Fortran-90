      HYPERBALL_VOLUME_QUAD <br> Quadrature Estimate of Hyperball Volume
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HYPERBALL_VOLUME_QUAD</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which 
      investigates the behavior of a quadrature rule when it is applied
      to the characteristic function of the unit M-dimensional
      hyperball, which is a discontinuous function.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The program integrates the function over the unit hypercube [-1,+1]^M,
      where the spatial dimension M is arbitrary.  The value of M is inferred
      from the user input quadrature rule information.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem used as example input to the program works in M = 6 dimensions.
      In that case, the volume of the hypercube is 64; the volume of the 
      hyperball is pi^3/6, or about 5.16771.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the integrand is discontinuous, any quadrature rule based on
      the idea of interpolation will probably be unable to do a good job.
      A family of quadrature rules, which rely on increasing the order of
      interpolation to improve accuracy, will probably get increasingly
      bad answers.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, a basic Monte Carlo rule, which assumes nothing about
      the function, integrates this function just as well as it integrates
      most any other square-integrable function.  (That's both the strength
      and weakness of the blunt instrument we call Monte Carlo integration.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The program assumes that the quadrature rule is defined by three text files.
