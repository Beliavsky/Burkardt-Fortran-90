      TSP_LAU <br> Heuristic Solution of Traveling Salesman Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TSP_LAU</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements a heuristic algorithm for solution of the traveling
      salesman problem, by Hang Tong Lau.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "traveling salesman problem" is given a list of cities, and
      seeks the shortest round trip that visits each location exactly
      once.  The obvious method of solution, to compute the length of every
      possible path, is not much worse than the best known method of
      solution, in terms of the amount of computing required to find the
      exact answer.  However, there are heuristic methods that can find a
      "reasonable" approximation to the answer for most problems, in a
      much shorter amount of time.
