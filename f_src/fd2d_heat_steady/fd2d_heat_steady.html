      FD2D_HEAT_STEADY <br> 2D Steady State Heat Equation in a Rectangle
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD2D_HEAT_STEADY</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      solves the steady state (time independent) heat equation in a 2D
      rectangular region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram:
      <pre>
                   U = 0, Y = 1.0
             +------------------+
             |                  |
    U = 10   |                  | U = 100
    X = 0.0  |                  | X = 2.0
             +------------------+
                   U = 0, Y = 0.0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is covered with a grid of NX by NY nodes, and an NX by NY
      array U is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
      array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
      indices of the four corners:
      <pre>
                  I = NY
             +------------------+
             |                  |
      J = 1  |                  |  J = NX
             |                  |
             +------------------+
                  I = 1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The form of the steady heat equation is
      <pre>
        - d/dx K(x,y) du/dx - d/dy K(x,y) du/dy = F(x,y)
      </pre>
      where K(x,y) is the heat conductivity, and F(x,y) is a
      heat source term.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using a simple finite difference approximation, this single equation
      can be replaced by NX * NY linear equations in NX * NY variables; 
      each equation is associated with one of the nodes in the mesh.  Nodes
      long the boundary generate boundary condition equations, while interior
      nodes generate equations that approximate the steady heat equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The linear system is sparse, and can easily be solved directly in MATLAB.
