      HAAR <br> The Haar Transform

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HAAR</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 library which
      computes the Haar transform of data.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the simplest case, one is given a vector X whose length N is a power of 2.
      We now consider consecutive pairs of entries of X, and for I from 0 to (N/2)-1
      we define:
      <pre>
        S[I] = ( X[2*I] + X[2*I+1] ) / sqrt ( 2 )
        D[I] = ( X[2*I] - X[2*I+1] ) / sqrt ( 2 )
      </pre>
      We now replace X by the vector S concatenated with D.  Assuming that (N/2)
      is greater than 1, we repeat the operation on the (N/2) entries of S, and
      so on, until we have reached a stage where our resultant S and D each contain
      one entry. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For data in the form of a 2D array, the transform is applied to the columns
      and then the rows.
