    <p>
      <b>DISTANCE_TO_POSITION</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      estimates the positions of cities given a city-to-city distance table.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2D, the problem is singular.  In particular, the position of one
      city is completely arbitrary, and one component of a second city is
      completely arbitrary (and a third city's position can be "flipped"
      about the line connecting cities one and two).  To remove some of this
      singularity, the code assigns city #1 the position (0,0) and city #2
      is given a 0 Y coordinate.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In N-dimensional space, a similar set of constraints must be placed
      on the first N cities, or the least squares solver is likely to fail.
      (That is, we specify all N components of the first city to be 0, 
      N-1 components of the second one, and so on, up to the N-th city
      which has a single 0 component).
    </p>

    <p>
      The computations carried out by this code assume that the cities
      lie on a plane.  If the distance data is for international cities,
      the effect of spherical geometry may make the planar approximation
      very bad.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the nonlinear least squares problem is set up, the routine
      UNCMIN from the NMS software package is called to compute a solution.
