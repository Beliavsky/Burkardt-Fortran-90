DISTANCE_TO_POSITION
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Read a distance table for N points or cities;
  assign coordinates to each point which will
  reproduce the distance table with the lowest
  discrepancy, in the least squares sense.
 
  Read the header of "grid04_dist.txt".
 
  Spatial dimension M =        2
  Number of points N  =        4
 
  Read the data in "grid04_dist.txt".

COMPUTE_POSITION_FROM_DISTANCE
  UNCMIN carries out unconstrained minimization
  of a scalar function of several variables.
0optstp    relative gradient close to zero.
 optstp    current iterate is probably solution.
 
UNCMIN - Note!
  INFO = 1.
  The iteration probably converged.
  The gradient is very small.
 
  UNCMIN return code =    1
