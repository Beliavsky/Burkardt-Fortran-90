      DIJKSTRA <br> Demonstration of Dijkstra's Minimum Distance Algorithm
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DIJKSTRA</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements a simple version of Dijkstra's algorithm for determining
      the minimum distance from one node in a graph to all other nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is mainly of interest as a starting point for a parallelization
      effort using OpenMP.
    </p>

    <p>
      The example graph handled by the program has 6 nodes and 8 links,
      each with a positive length:
      <pre>
    N0--15--N2-100--N3
      \      |     /
       \     |    /
        40  20  10
          \  |  /
           \ | /
            N1
            / \
           /   \
          6    25
         /       \
        /         \
      N5----8-----N4
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Using "Inf" to indicate that there is no link between two nodes,
      the distance matrix for this graph is:
      <pre>
          0   40   15  Inf  Inf  Inf
         40    0   20   10   25    6
         15   20    0  100  Inf  Inf
        Inf   10  100    0  Inf  Inf
        Inf   25  Inf  Inf    0    8
        Inf    6  Inf  Inf    8    0
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently determines the length of the shortest
      path from node 0 to other nodes as:
      <pre>
        From 0 to:  0    1    2    3    4    5
        Distance:   0   35   15   45   49   41
      </pre>
    </p>
