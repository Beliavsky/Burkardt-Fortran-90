      <b>fsplit</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      reads a FORTRAN file and creates individual files for every
      function, program, or subroutine in the file,
      by Van Snyder.
    </p>

    <p>
      This utility can be convenient when your goal is to create a
      UNIX "ar" archive of the compiled object code.  By splitting
      your source code up, and compiling each routine separately,
      you end up with a library in which each compiled module is
      individual listed and replaceable.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>fsplit</b> &lt; <i>myprog.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>myprog.f90</i> is the file to be split.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Command line arguments may be specified:
      <ul>
        <li>
          "-v" indicates verbose mode, in which messages are printed.
        </li>
        <li>
          "-a" indicates append mode, in which case the program appends
          the name of the program, subroutine or function to each "end" 
          statement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
