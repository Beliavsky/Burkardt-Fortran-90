      <b>graphics_dislin_test</b>,
      FORTRAN90 codes which
      illustrate how various kinds of data can be displayed and analyzed
      graphically, using the dislin() graphics package.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some common plot types include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>animation</b>, a sequential display of images which are meant
          to suggest motion or evolution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>bar</b>, a display of values y(1:n) in which every value
          y(i) is represented by a bar of that height.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>bar3d</b>, a display of values z(1:m,1:n) over a 2D grid,
          in which every value z(i,j) is represented by a bar of that height.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>barh</b>, a display of values x(1:n) in which every value
          x(i) is represented by a horizontal bar of that length.
          The horizontal format can be more suitable for labeling bars
          when there are many of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>binary_tree</b>, a connected directed graph with no circuits, 
          in which each node has no more than 2 descendants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>contour fill</b>, a display of values z(x,y) in which the values of
          z are suggested by regions filled with color.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>contour line</b>, a display of values z(x,y) in which the values of
          z are suggested by colored contour lines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>decision_tree</b>, a connected directed graph with no circuits, 
          in which labeled nodes represent current states to be tested, and edges 
          represent the choice or decision to move from one state to another.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>dendrogram</b>, a connected directed graph with no circuits, 
          which generally has a single root node, and illustrates the
          genealogy or relatedness of a set of objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>digraph</b>, a "directed graph", nodes (possibly with defined
          locations, labels or colors), connected by directed edges 
          (possibly with defined weights, labels, colors or linestyles).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>fill</b>, a shape composed of polygons, each of which is
          filled with a particular color.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>graph</b>, nodes (possibly with defined locations, labels or colors), 
          connected by undirected edges (possibly with defined weights, labels, 
          colors or linestyles).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>histogram</b>, a display of values x in which the x range
          is divided into intervals, and the value y(i) represents the
          number of x values in the i-th interval, and a bar plot of
          intervals versus count is displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>plot</b>, a display of a single curve defined by a sequence of 
          functional pairs (x,y(x)), or a function y=f(x) sampled over an
          interval, or a sequence of related pairs (x,y).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>plot3d</b>, a 3D display of a single curve defined by a sequence of 
          triples (x(i),y(i),z(i)), or a parametric function (x(t),y(t),z(t)) 
          sampled over an interval.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>plots</b>, several curves on a single display.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>scatter</b>, a display of unconnected pairs (x,y), whose
          positions are indicated by markers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>scatter3d</b>, a 3D display of unconnected triples (x,y,z), whose
          positions are indicated by markers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>scatters</b>, a scatter plot involving several distinct sets of
          (x,y) pairs are displayed, distinguished by markers of different
          size, shape or color.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>subplots</b>, a display involving two or more separate plots,
          shown as a single figure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>surface</b>, a 3D display of values z(x,y), represented
          as a surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>vector</b>, a 2D display of vectors (u,v)(x,y), representing
          a gradient field, an ODE direction field, or a flow of some kind.
        </li>
      </ul>
