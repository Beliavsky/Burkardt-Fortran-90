    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BURGERS_SOLUTION</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      evaluates exact solutions of the time-dependent 1D viscous Burgers equation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The form of the Burgers equation considered here is:
      <pre>
        du       du        d^2 u
        -- + u * -- = nu * -----
        dt       dx        dx^2
      </pre>
      for -1.0 < x < +1.0, and 0.0 < t.
    </p>
