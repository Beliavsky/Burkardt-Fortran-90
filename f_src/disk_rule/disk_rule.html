      DISK_RULE <br> Quadrature Rules for the General Disk
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>DISK_RULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes quadrature rules for approximating integrals
      over the interior of the general disk in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user specifies values NT and NR, where NT is the number of equally
      spaced angles, and NR controls the number of radial points, the center of
      the disk (XC,YC), and the radius of the disk RC.  The program
      returns vectors W(NR*NT), X(NR*NT) and Y(NR*NT), which define the rule Q(f).
    </p>

    <p>
      To use a rule that is equally powerful in R and T, typically, set
      NT = 2 * NR.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given NT, NR, and the quadrature vectors W, X, Y, the integral I(f) is estimated
      by Q(f) as follows:
      <pre>
        s = w' * f(x,y)
        area = pi * rc ^ 2;
        q = area * s;
      </pre>
    </p>
