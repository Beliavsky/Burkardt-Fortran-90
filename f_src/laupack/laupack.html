      LAUPACK <br> Graph routines by Hang Tong Lau
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LAUPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes properties of mathematical graphs, including Euler circuits,
      Hamiltonian circuits, cliques, strongly connected components, minimal
      spanning tree, chromatic number, shortest paths, maximal flow,
      and planarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines are included to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          find an Euler circuit (use every edge once);
        </li>
        <li>
          find a Hamilton circuit (visit every node once);
        </li>
        <li>
          find cliques (nodes that are all connected to each other);
        </li>
        <li>
          find the strongly connected components of a directed graph;
        </li>
        <li>
          find a minimum spanning tree (the shortest collection of edges
          that leave the graph connected);
        </li>
        <li>
          find the chromatic number (the number of colors necessary to
          paint each node, with no adjacent nodes the same color);
        </li>
        <li>
          find the K shortest paths in a graph whose edge lengths are given;
        </li>
        <li>
          find the maximal flow in a graph with source and sink nodes,
          and edge capacities;
        </li>
        <li>
          determine if a graph is planar;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
