      CALPAK <br> Calendar Calculations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CALPAK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes various simple calendrical quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      These include converting
      from day-number/year to day/month/year format, calculating the time
      difference between two dates, finding the day of the week of a given date,
      and other feats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some common methods of marking the date include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>JED</b>, the Julian Ephemeris Date, a count of days since
          a long time ago;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>YMD</b>, for "year, month, day";
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>YJ</b>, for "year, day number".
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      While there have been many calendars over the years, it
      is instructive to contemplate just the crazy story of our
      current "common" calendar.  To this day, people disagree about
      whether there was a year 0, although the Julian calendar
      was a Roman invention, and Dionysius Exiguus, who gets the
      blame for shifting the Julian calendar's starting date to
      the birth year of Christ four hundred years afterwards, didn't
      have an accurate idea of when that was.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was a
      controversial shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
      which took place <i>piecemeal</i> throughout the Catholic
      world, with several countries actually switching back and
      forth more than once, and with England holding out on the
      old system until after George Washington was born (which
      means he was born on February 11 AND February 22).
    </p>

    <p>
      People didn't agree on when the year started, so that January and
      February, in particular, were a little murky about which
      year they belonged to, and the year sometimes started
      around March 22, near the vernal equinox.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a number of side issues, including
      <ul>
        <li>
          determining the day of the week of a given date;
        </li>
        <li>
          determining the number of days between two dates;
        </li>
        <li>
          the computation of the date of certain holidays;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
