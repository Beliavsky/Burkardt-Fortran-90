      <b>sphere_design_rule_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      calls sphere_design_rule(), which
      implements a number of Hardin and Sloane "spherical designs", which
      can be used for numerical quadrature
      over the surface of a sphere in 3D.

      sphere_design_rule</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      returns point sets
      on the surface of the unit sphere in 3D, 
      known as designs,
      which can be useful for estimating integrals on the surface.
