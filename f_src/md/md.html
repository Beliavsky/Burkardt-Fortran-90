    <p>
      <b>MD</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out a molecular dynamics simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computation involves following the paths of particles which
      exert a distance-dependent force on each other.  The particles
      are not constrained by any walls; if particles meet, they simply
      pass through each other.
    </p>

    </p>
      The problem is treated as a coupled set of differential equations.
      The system of differential equation is discretized by choosing a 
      discrete time step.  Given the position and velocity of each particle
      at one time step, the algorithm estimates these values at the next time step.
    </p>

    <p>
      To compute the next position of each particle requires the evaluation of 
      the right hand side of its corresponding differential equation.  Since each 
      of these calculations is independent, there is a potential speedup if the 
      program can take advantage of parallel computing.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version of the program is intended as a starting point; 
      students are asked to examine the program and add the appropriate
      OpenMP directives to run it in parallel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this program exhibits a remarkable speedup if we simply
      compile it with the "-O2" optimization option.
