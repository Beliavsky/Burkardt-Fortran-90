      FEM2D_HEAT <br>
      Finite Element Solution of the Heat Equation <br>
      on a Triangulated Region
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FEM2D_HEAT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      applies the finite element method to solve
      a form of the time-dependent heat equation over an arbitrary
      triangulated region.
    </p>

    <p>
      The computational region is initially unknown by the code.  The user
      specifies it by preparing a file containing the coordinates of
      the nodes, and a file containing the indices of nodes that make
      up triangles that form a triangulation of the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the user does not type in this information by hand, but has
      a code fill in the nodes, and perhaps another code that
      constructs the triangulation.  However, in the simplest case,
      the user might construct a very crude triangulation by hand, and
      have 
      TRIANGULATION_REFINE refine it to something more reasonable.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the following ridiculously small example:
      <pre>
       10-11-12
        |\   |\
        | \  | \
        6  7 8  9
        |   \|   \
        1-2--3--4-5
      </pre>
      the node file would be:
      <pre>
         0.0  0.0
         1.0  0.0
         2.0  0.0
         3.0  0.0
         4.0  0.0
         0.0  1.0
         1.0  1.0
         2.0  1.0
         3.0  1.0
         0.0  2.0
         1.0  2.0
         2.0  2.0
      </pre>
      and the triangle file would be
      <pre>
         1  3 10  2  7  6
         3  5 12  4  9  8
        12 10  3 11  7  8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is set up to handle the time dependent heat
      equation with a right hand side function, and nonhomogeneous
      Dirichlet boundary conditions.   The state variable
      U(T,X,Y) is then constrained by:
      <pre>
        Ut - ( Uxx + Uyy ) + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t)  in the region
                                        U = G(x,y,t)  on the boundary
                                        U = H(x,y,t)  at initial time TINIT.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      To specify the right hand side function F(x,y,t), the linear
      coefficient K(x,y,t), the boundary condition function G(x,y,t),
      and the initial condition H(x,y,t),
      the user has to supply a file containing four subroutines,
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE RHS ( N, X, Y, TIME, U )</b> 
          evaluates the right hand side forcing term F(x,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE K_COEF ( N, X, Y, TIME, U )</b> evaluates Kx,y,t);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE DIRICHLET_CONDITION ( N, X, Y, TIME, U )</b>
          evaluates G(x,y,t), and is only called at nodes on the boundary;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SUBROUTINE INITIAL_CONDITION ( N, X, Y, TIME, U )</b>
          evaluates H(x,y,t), and is only called for TIME = TINIT.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To run the code, the user compiles the user routines,
      links them with FEM2D_HEAT, and runs the executable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code writes out a file containing an Encapsulated
      PostScript image of the nodes and elements, with numbers.
      If there are too many nodes, the plot may be too cluttered
      to read.  For lower values, however, it is
      a valuable map of what is going on in the geometry.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is also able to write out a file containing the
      solution value at every node.  This file may be used to create
      contour plots of the solution.
