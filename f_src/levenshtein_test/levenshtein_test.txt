LEVENSHTEIN_TEST
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the LEVENSHTEIN library.

LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE_TEST:
  LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE computes the Levenshtein distance
  between two strings.

  S = "water"
  T = "wine"
  Computed distance =    3
  Correct distance  =    3

  S = "kitten"
  T = "sitting"
  Computed distance =    3
  Correct distance  =    3

  S = "saturday"
  T = "sunday"
  Computed distance =    3
  Correct distance  =    3

  S = "pheromones"
  T = "photographer"
  Computed distance =    8
  Correct distance  =    8

LEVENSHTEIN_MATRIX_TEST:
  LEVENSHTEIN_MATRIX computes the Levenshtein matrix
  associated with the computation of the Levenshtein
  distance between two strings.

  S = "water"
  T = "wine"
