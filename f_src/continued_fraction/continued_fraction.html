    <p>
      <b>CONTINUED_FRACTION</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements some simple algorithms for dealing with simple and
      generalized continued fractions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematically, continued fractions are infinite sums.  In general,
      they are treated computationally as finite sums.  Here we will assume
      that all such sums terminate at index N.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple continued fraction (SCF) is a representation of a number
      R as:
      <pre>
        R = A0 + 1 / ( A1 + 1 / ( A2 + 1 / ( A3 + ... + 1 / AN )...)))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A generalized continued fraction (GCF) is a representation of a number
      R as:
      <pre>
        R = A0 + B1 / ( A1 + B2 / ( A2 + B3 / ( A3 + ... + BN / AN )...)))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For either form of continued fraction, there are two tasks:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Given a value R, determine an N-term SCF or GCF which is equal to,
          or approximates, R.
        </li>
        <li>
          Given the coefficients of an SCF or GCF, determine the sequence
          of rational values represented by computing the partial sums.
          The final sum is the value R.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
