  Work on the "Ketel One Vodka" problem.
 
  The following challenge appeared in 
  the New York Times, 14 June 2007: 
 
  "Dear Ketel One Drinker: 
  Can you make one hundred words, of four letters
  or more, from the letters in Ketel One Vodka?"
 
  Examine a file "wordlist.txt"
  full of words, and look for "sub-anagrams" 
  (words whose letters are a subset of the target ones).
 
  We only consider words of length at least        4
 
  Copy sub-anagrams to "ketel_one.txt".
  
   Number of words checked                        300260
   Number of words that were "long enough"        298513
   Number of sub-anagrams found                      514
 
ketel_one():
  Normal end of execution.
