PATTERSON_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Look up a Gauss-Patterson rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME.
 
  ORDER is 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255 or 511.
  A is the left endpoint.
  B is the right endpoint.
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
 
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =       15
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "gp_o15".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "gp_o15".
 
  Weight file will be   "gp_o15_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "gp_o15_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "gp_o15_r.txt".
 
PATTERSON_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
