      LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS <br> Exactness of Gauss-Legendre Quadrature Rules
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of Gauss-Legendre
      quadrature rules for the interval [-1,+1].
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is actually appropriate for any quadrature
      rule that estimates integrals on [-1,+1], and which does not including
      a weighting function <b>w(x)</b> in the integral.  This includes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Clenshaw-Curtis</i> rules;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Fejer</i> rules of Type 1 or 2;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Gauss-Legendre</i> rules;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Gauss-Lobatto</i> rules (Gauss rule including both endpoints);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Gauss-Patterson</i> rules;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Gauss-Radau</i> rules (Gauss rule including one endpoint);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Newton-Cotes</i> rules, open and closed forms;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature assumes that the integrand we are
      considering has a form like:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -1 &lt;= x &lt;= +1 ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule</i> is a set of <b>n</b>
      positive weights <b>w</b> and abscissas <b>x</b> so that
      <pre>
        Integral ( -1 &lt;= x &lt;= +1 ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
      may be approximated by
      <pre>
        Sum ( 1 &lt;= I &lt;= N ) w(i) * f(x(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a standard Gauss-Legendre rule, polynomial exactness is defined in terms of
      the function <b>f(x)</b>.  That is, we say the rule is exact for polynomials
      up to degree DEGREE_MAX if, for any polynomial <b>f(x)</b> of that degree or
      less, the quadrature rule will produce the exact value of
      <pre>
        Integral ( -1 &lt;= x &lt;= +1 ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program starts at <b>DEGREE</b> = 0, and then
      proceeds to <b>DEGREE</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>DEGREE</b>,
      the program generates the corresponding monomial term, applies the
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error.  For comparison,
      it also computes and prints the error for the trapezoid rule of the same order.
      The program uses a scaling factor on each monomial so that the exact integral
      should always be 1; therefore, each reported error can be compared
      on a fixed scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule
      is defined by three files, to be read at input, and the
      maximum degree top be checked is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the three files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i>
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all three files.
    </p>

    <p>
      For information on the form of these files, see the
      <b>QUADRATURE_RULES</b> directory listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exactness results are written to an output file with the
      corresponding name:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>exact.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>legendre_exactness</b> <i>prefix</i> <i>degree_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the abscissa, weight
          and region information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum monomial degree to check.  This would normally be
          a relatively small nonnegative number, such as 5, 10 or 15.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
