      <b>toms672</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes a quadrature rule which is a maximally accurate extension of a
      given quadrature rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is, we suppose we have a quadrature rule that uses N points, and
      that we wish to compute a new quadrature rule, which uses N+M points.
      The new rule is required to include the original N points of the old rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      This kind of procedure is analogous to the process by which the
      nested Gauss-Patterson rules were developed.  Thus, one use of the
      software is to try to develop nested families of rules for other
      weight functions, or starting from other initial rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      In certain cases, this algorithm <i>may</i> be able to extend the given
      rule in a way which produces a rule with the maximum possible precision.
      (However, it is also possible that the extension cannot be made.)
    </p>

    <p>
      By calling this algorithm repeatedly, it is possible to compute a family
      of nested quadrature rules of any order.  Nested rules can be efficient when
      function evaluations are expensive, and a series of integral estimates must
      be made to estimate accuracy, or to detect convergence.
