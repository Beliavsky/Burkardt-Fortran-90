      FD_PREDATOR_PREY <br> Finite Difference Solution of a Predator Prey ODE System
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FD_PREDATOR_PREY</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      applies the finite difference method to estimate solutions of a
      pair of ordinary differential equations that model the behavior of
      a pair of predator and prey populations, and plots the data with
      gnuplot().
    </p>

    <p>
      The physical system under consideration is a pair of animal populations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PREY reproduce rapidly; for each animal alive at the beginning of the
      year, two more will be born by the end of the year.  The prey do not have
      a natural death rate; instead, they only die by being eaten by the predator.
      Every prey animal has 1 chance in 1000 of being eaten in a given year by
      a given predator.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PREDATORS only die of starvation, but this happens very quickly.
      If unfed, a predator will tend to starve in about 1/10 of a year.
      On the other hand, the predator reproduction rate is dependent on
      eating prey, and the chances of this depend on the number of available prey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The resulting differential equations can be written:
      <pre>
        PREY(0) = 5000
        PRED(0) =  100

        d PREY / dT =    2 * PREY(T) - 0.001 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)
        d PRED / dT = - 10 * PRED(T) + 0.002 * PREY(T) * PRED(T)
      </pre>
      Here, the initial values (5000,100) are a somewhat arbitrary starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The pair of ordinary differential equations that result have an interesting
      behavior.  For certain choices of the interaction coefficients (such as
      those given here), the populations of predator and prey will tend to
      a periodic oscillation.  The two populations will be out of phase; the number
      of prey will rise, then after a delay, the predators will rise as the prey
      begins to fall, causing the predator population to crash again.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this code, the pair of ODE's is solved with a simple finite difference
      approximation using a fixed step size.  In general, this is NOT an efficient
      or reliable way of solving differential equations.  However, this code is
      intended to illustrate the ideas of finite difference approximation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, if we choose a fixed time step size DT, then a derivative
      such as dPREY/dT is approximated by:
      <pre>
        d PREY / dT = approximately ( PREY(T+DT) - PREY(T) ) / DT
      </pre>
      which means that the first differential equation can be written as
      <pre>
        PREY(T+DT) = PREY(T) + DT * ( 2 * PREY(T) - 0.001 * PREY(T) * PRED(T) ).
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can rewrite the equation for PRED as well.  Then, since we know the
      values of PRED and PREY at time 0, we can use these finite difference
      equations to estimate the values of PRED and PREY at time DT.  These values
      can be used to get estimates at time 2*DT, and so on.  To get from time
      T_START = 0 to time T_STOP = 5, we simply take STEP_NUM steps each of size
      <pre>
        DT = ( T_STOP - T_START ) / STEP_NUM
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Because finite differences are only an approximation to derivatives, this
      process only produces estimates of the solution.  And these estimates tend
      to become more inaccurate for large values of time.  Usually, we can reduce
      this error by decreasing DT and taking more, smaller time steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, for instance, taking just 100 steps gives nonsensical
      answers.  Using STEP_NUM = 1000 gives an approximate solution that seems
      to have the right kind of oscillatory behavior, except that the amplitude
      of the waves increases with each repetition.  Using 10000 steps, the
      approximation begins to become accurate enough that we can see that the
      waves seem to have a fixed period and amplitude.
