double_complex_test.
  FORTRAN90 version.
  Demonstrate double precision complex arithmetic.
 
TEST01
  Use complex values of the default type.
 
  RANGE provides the decimal exponent range.
    RANGE(I1) =           37
 
  KIND returns the "kind" of a given integer.
  Do you expect a value of 4, or of 8?
    KIND(I1) =            4
 
   A =              (1.00000000,1.00000000)
   B = sqrt ( A ) =             (1.09868419,0.455089837)
   C = A - B * B =        (-2.384185791E-07,0.00000000)
 
TEST02
  Use complex values of KIND = 8.
 
  RANGE provides the decimal exponent range.
    RANGE(A) =          307
 
  KIND returns the "kind" of a given integer.
    KIND(A) =            8
 
   A =                (1.0000000000000000,1.0000000000000000)
   B = sqrt ( A ) =               (1.0986841134678100,0.45508986056222733)
   C = A - B * B =         (-2.22044604925031308E-016,0.0000000000000000)
 
TEST03
  Use "DOUBLE COMPLEX" values.
 
   A =                (1.0000000000000000,1.0000000000000000)
   B = sqrt ( A ) =               (1.0986841134678100,0.45508986056222733)
   C = A - B * B =         (-2.22044604925031308E-016,0.0000000000000000)
 
double_complex_test.
  Normal end of execution.
