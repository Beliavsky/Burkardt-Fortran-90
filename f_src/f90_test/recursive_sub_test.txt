RECURSIVE_SUB_TEST
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  Demonstrate recursive subroutine definitions.
 
  We sort a vector by recursion.
  Our recursive step finds the largest element and moves
  it to the end.
 
  Unsorted vector:
 
         1             2
         2            10
         3             9
         4             6
         5             4
         6             0
         7             2
         8             1
         9             0
        10             6
 
  Sorted vector:
 
         1             0
         2             0
         3             1
         4             2
         5             2
         6             4
         7             6
         8             6
         9             9
        10            10
 
RECURSIVE_SUB_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
