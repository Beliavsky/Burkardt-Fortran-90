BIG_INTS_REAL:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Storing big integers in real variables.

TEST01
  Compute the largest possible integers.
  Try to store them as real values.
  Then copy them back.

  "Huge" integers and huge reals:

  i4 = huge ( integer ( kind = 4 ) ) =                 2147483647
  i8 = huge ( integer ( kind = 8 ) ) =        9223372036854775807
  r4 = huge ( real ( kind = 4 ) ) =                  0.340282E+39
  r8 = huge ( real ( kind = 8 ) ) =                  0.179769+309

  Convert huge integers to real values:

  r4i4 = real ( i4, kind = 4 ) =                   0.214748E+10
  r4i8 = real ( i8, kind = 4 ) =                   0.922337E+19
  r8i4 = real ( i4, kind = 8 ) =                   0.214748E+10
  r8i8 = real ( i8, kind = 8 ) =                   0.922337E+19

  Convert real values of integers back to integers:

  i4r4i4 = int ( r4i4, kind = 4 ) =                 -2147483648
  i4r8i4 = int ( r8i4, kind = 4 ) =                  2147483647
  i8r4i8 = int ( r4i8, kind = 8 ) =        -9223372036854775808
  i8r8i8 = int ( r8i8, kind = 8 ) =        -9223372036854775808

TEST02
  Find the least nonnegative integer I
  for which int(real(I)) /= I
  We use integer ( kind = 4 ) and real ( kind = 4 )
  arithmetic.

  I4 =                       16777217
  R4I4 =                     16777216.
  I4R4I4 =                   16777216

TEST03
  Find the least nonnegative integer I4
  for which int(real(I4)) /= I4
  We use integer ( kind = 4 ) and real ( kind = 8 )
  arithmetic.

  I4 reached the maximum value.
  No violations were found!

TEST04
  Let I and J be consecutive integer ( kind = 4 ) values.
  Let A and B be real ( kind = 4 ) copies of I and J.
  Seek I and J for which ( B - A ) is not 1.

   i =             16777216
   j = i + 1 =     16777217
   j - i =                1
   a = real ( i, kind = 4 ) =    16777216.0    
   b = real ( j, kind = 4 ) =    16777216.0    
   b - a                    =    0.00000000    

TEST05
  Let I and J be consecutive integer ( kind = 4 ) values.
  Let A and B be real ( kind = 8 ) copies of I and J.
  Seek I and J for which ( B - A ) is not 1.

  Reached the maximum integer value.
  No violations were found!

  Normal end of execution.
