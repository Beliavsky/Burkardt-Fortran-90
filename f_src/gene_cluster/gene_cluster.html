      GENE_CLUSTER <br> Cluster Genetic Expression Data

    <p>
      <b>GENE_CLUSTER</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      divides a set of genetic data into clusters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data comes from genetic expression experiments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each cluster will be defined in terms of a representative data
      vector, and the clustering minimizes the sum of
      the squares of the "distances" of each data point to its cluster
      representative.  Here, the "distance" may be either the Euclidean
      distance or a similarity measure based on angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data to be examined is assumed to be stored in a file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The file is assumed to contain a number of records, with each
      record stored on its own line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each record, in turn, contains a fixed number of data values
      that describe a particular gene expression experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each record will be regarded as a point in N dimensional space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program will try to cluster the data, that is, to organize
      the data by defining a number of cluster centers, which are
      also points in N dimensional space, and assigning each record
      to the cluster associated with a particular center.
    </p>

    <p>
      The method of assigning data aims to minimize the cluster energy,
      which is taken to be the sum of the squares of the distances of
      each data point from its cluster center.
    </p>

    <p>
      In some contexts, it makes sense to use the usual Euclidean sort
      of distance.  In others, it may make more sense to replace each
      data record by a normalized version, and to assign distance
      by computing angles between the unit vectors.
