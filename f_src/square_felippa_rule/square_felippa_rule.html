    <p>
      <b>SQUARE_FELIPPA_RULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      generates the points and weights of a Felippa quadrature rule over
      the interior of a square in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actually, the word "square" is meant to designate any quadrature region
      defined by:
      <pre>
        A(1) <= X <= B(1)
        A(2) <= Y <= B(2)
      </pre>
