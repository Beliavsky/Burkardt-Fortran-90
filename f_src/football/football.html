      <b>FOOTBALL</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      ranks college football teams.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sample file of scores is available from
      Knuth's Stanford Graph Base.  The code reads this file, computes
      a scoring matrix, and determines a ranking.  At the moment, only
      some of Keener's methods have been implemented.

      LADDERS</a>,
      a C code which
      seeks to transform one five letter word into another, by changing
      one letter at a time, using only legitimate English words.  This
      puzzle was invented by Lewis Carroll, who called it "Doublets", but
      it is also known as "Word Ladders" or "Word Gold".  The code 
      is by Donald Knuth.
