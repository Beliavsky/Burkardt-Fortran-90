    <p>
      <b>TETRAHEDRON_INTEGRALS</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      returns the exact value of the integral of any monomial
      over the interior of the unit tetrahedron in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interior of the unit tetrahedron in 3D is defined by
      <pre>
        0 <= x
        0 <= y
        0 <= z
             x + y + z <= 1
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The integrands are all of the form
      <pre>
        f(x,y,z) = x^e1 * y^e2 * z^e3
      </pre>
      where the exponents are nonnegative integers.
