MATRIX_MULTIPLY:
  FORTRAN90 version.
 
  This program:
  * generates matrices A and B;
  * writes them to files;
  * calls MATLAB (via the SYSTEM routine) which
    ** reads A and B from files;
    ** computes C = A * B;
    ** writes C to a file;
  * reads C from the file;
  * reports the success of the computation.
 
  Matrix order N =       10
  Matrix parameter ALPHA =    2.00000    
  Matrix parameter BETA =     3.00000    
 
  Issued call to MATLAB.
 
  MATLAB sesion terminated normally.
 
  Frobenius norm of A * B - I is    0.00000    
 
MATRIX_MULTIPLY:
  Normal end of execution.
