    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>F90_CALLS_MATLAB</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can interact with MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these examples, the interaction is done through the SYSTEM
      command, which allows a FORTRAN90 code to issue a command to
      the operating system, and to receive a result flag indicating the
      successful completion or failure of that command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SYSTEM command is not a standard or intrinsic routine
      defined by the FORTRAN standard.  However, it is often available
      to FORTRAN codemers on UNIX systems.  In particular, the GNU GFORTRAN
      and IBM XLF compilers include this routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data can be passed between MATLAB and FORTRAN using text files.

      Examples and Tests:

    <p>
      <b>MATRIX_MULTIPLY</b> shows how a FORTRAN90 code can cooperate
      with MATLAB.  The FORTRAN90 code generates two matrices A and B,
      writes them to files, and invokes MATLAB with a particular M-file.
      The M-file reads the matrices from the files, computes the product C
      and writes it to a file.  The FORTRAN90 code resumes execution,
      reading the C file and reporting the result.
