BACKTRACK_BINARY_RC_TEST:
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test the BACKTRACK_BINARY_RC library.
 
TEST01
  Use BACKBIN_RC to find the binary expansion of
  an integer between 0 and 255.
  The choices are 0/1 for the 8 digits.
 
  TARGET =   73
  Number of calls =     13
  Binary search space =        256
   0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
 
  TARGET =  299
  Termination without solution.
  Number of calls =    511
  Binary search space =        256
  -1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
 
  TARGET =   -3
  Termination without solution.
  Number of calls =      3
  Binary search space =        256
  -1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
 
TEST02
  Use BACKBIN_RC to seek subsets of a set W
  that sum to a given target value.
  The choices are 0/1 to select each element of W.
 
  TARGET =   53
 
   1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
   1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
   0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1

  Number of calls =    217
  Binary search space =        256

BACKTRACK_BINARY_RC_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
