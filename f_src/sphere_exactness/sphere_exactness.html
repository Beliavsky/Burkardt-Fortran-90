      SPHERE_EXACTNESS <br> 
      Exactness of Quadrature on the Unit Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_EXACTNESS</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a quadrature rule 
      over the surface of the unit sphere in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polynomial exactness of a quadrature rule is defined as the
      highest total degree D such that the quadrature rule is
      guaranteed to integrate exactly all polynomials of total degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> or less, ignoring roundoff.
      The total degree of a polynomial is the maximum of the degrees 
      of all its monomial terms.  For the unit sphere in 3D, the degree of a monomial
      term is the sum of the exponents of <b>x</b>, <b>y</b> and <b>z</b>. 
      Thus, for instance, the <b>DEGREE</b> of 
      <blockquote><b>
        x<sup>2</sup>yz<sup>5</sup>
      </b></blockquote>
      is 2+1+5=8.
    </p>

    <p>
      To be thorough, the program starts at <b>DEGREE</b> = 0, and then 
      proceeds to <b>DEGREE</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree 
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>DEGREE</b>,
      the program generates every possible monomial term, applies the 
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The quadrature rule is read by the program, and there are a number of
      options for how that information is stored.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>sphere_exactness</b> <i>files</i> <i>prefix</i> <i>degree_max</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>files</i> indicates how the quadrature rule is stored (see below);
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum total monomial degree to check.  
          A value of 5 or 10 might be reasonable, but a value of 50 or 100 
          is probably never a good input!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The input value of <b>files</b> indicates how the quadrature rule information
      is stored.  It might be in one or two files; the abscissas might be
      stored as (X,Y,Z) or as angles.  The angles might be in radians or degrees.
      The weights might be assumed to be equal, in which case they need not be input.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>XYZW</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>xyzw</b> containing (X,Y,Z,Weight);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RTPW</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>rtpw</b> containing  (Theta, Phi, Weight) (radians);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DTPW</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>dtpw</b> containing  (Theta, Phi, Weight) (degrees);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>XYZ+W</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>xyz</b> containing (X,Y,Z)
          and file <i>prefix</i>.<b>w</b> containing Weight;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RTP+W</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>rtp</b> containing (Theta, Phi ) in radians,
          and file <i>prefix</i>.<b>w</b> containing Weight;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DTP+W</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>dtp</b> containing (Theta, Phi ) in degrees,
          and file <i>prefix</i>.<b>w</b> containing Weight;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>XYZ1</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>xyz</b> containing (X,Y,Z), 
          and equal weights, which do not need to be read in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>RTP1</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>rtp</b> containing (Theta, Phi ) in radians,
          and equal weights, which do not need to be read in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DTP1</b> for file <i>prefix</i>.<b>dtp</b> containing (Theta, Phi ) in degrees,
