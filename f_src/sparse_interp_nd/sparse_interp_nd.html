      SPARSE_INTERP_ND <br> Multidimensional Sparse Interpolant
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPARSE_INTERP_ND</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      constructs a sparse interpolant to a function f(x) of
      a multidimensional argument x.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem is defined as follows: for any point x in some M-dimensional 
      product space X, such as the unit hypercube, we are able to provide the 
      value f(x) for some function f().  We wish to determine a new function g(), 
      (the interpolant) which will match the value of f() on some specified set 
      of points {xi}.  Presumably, we choose the number and location of the
      points {xi} to ensure that the interpolating function g() is a good fit
      to f().
    </p>

    <p>
      There are standard techniques for producing a family of interpolants g(j)(),
      such that, as we increase the index j, the interpolating process will exactly
      match any function f() which happens to be a polynomial of limited degree.
      The usual techniques for doing this are derived from tensor product interpolants,
      whose expense grows exponentially with the spatial dimension.
    </p>

    <p>
      For simplicity,
      we'll assume that the argument space X is the unit hypercube, and that we
      have a family of 1D interpolation rules g(j)(), where the index j is an indication
      of the precision of the interpolation rule.  A typical tensor product interpolant
      G(J)() can then be thought of as constructed by the product
      <pre>
        G(J)(X) = g(j1)(x1) * g(j2)(x2) * ... * g(jm)(xm).
      </pre>
      where, of course, J = (j1,j2,...jm) and X = (x1,x2,...,xm).
    </p>

    <p>
      A procedure due to Smolyak, which is more typically applied to problems in
      quadrature, can also be used for the interpolation problem.  The Smolyak
      interpolation rule of level L is defined by
      <pre>
        A(L,M) = sum ( L-M+1 <= |J| <= L ) C(|J|) * g(j1)(x1) * g(j2)(x2) * ... * g(jm)(xm).
      </pre>
      Here |J| = j1+j2+...+jm, and, for each |J|, the sum must be taken over all
      possible vectors J with nonnegative integer entries that sum to |J|.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, a naive implementation of a sparse interpolant would, for a given spatial
      dimension M, pick a level L, determine the (at most L+1) coefficients C(),
      construct every tensor product interpolant of total degree L or less, evaluate
      each interpolant at the point X, and combine these values with the appropriate
      weights C() to arrive at the sparse grid interpolant value at X.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some improvements to this approach can be suggested.  First, many of the
      coefficients C() may be zero, because the coefficient vector C for an
      M-dimensional sparse interpolant of level L will have at most M nonzero coefficients.
      Secondly, if the 1D interpolation family is chosen so that the interpolant points
      of successive members are nested, then it is possible to simplify the evaluation
      process greatly.
