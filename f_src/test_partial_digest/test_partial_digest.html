    <p>
      <b>TEST_PARTIAL_DIGEST</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can generate example cases of the partial digest problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the partial digest problem, we assume that there are <b>N</b>
      objects arranged along a line.  We denote the position of object <b>I</b>
      by <b>X(I)</b>.  The positions of the objects are unknown.  Instead,
      we have a list of the distances between every distinct pair of objects.
      Note that the distances are not "tagged"; that is, if there is a 175
      on the list of distances, we don't know which two objects are separated
      by that distance.  In the partial digest problem, we start with the
      <b>(N*(N-1))/2</b> distances D, and must come up with at least one
      linear arrangement of <b>N</b> objects that corresponds to the distances.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use this library, the user specifies a number of objects N, and
      a maximum separation DMAX.  The library will generate N object locations
      in an array called LOCATE, and the corresponding list of distances D.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          N must be at least 2.           
        </li>
        <li>
          DMAX must be at least N - 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          The entries in LOCATE will be distinct integers in ascending order.
        </li>     
        <li>
          LOCATE(1) = 0 and LOCATE(N) = DMAX. 
        </li>
      </ul>
