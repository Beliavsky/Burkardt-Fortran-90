    <p>
      <b>LINPACK_D</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      solves systems of linear
      equations for a variety of matrix types and storage modes.
    </p>

    <p>
      LINPACK has officially been superseded by the
      LAPACK library.  The LAPACK
      library uses more modern algorithms and code structure.  However,
      the LAPACK library can be extraordinarily complex; what is done
      in a single LINPACK routine may correspond to 10 or 20 utility
      routines in LAPACK.  This is fine if you treat LAPACK as a black
      box.  But if you wish to learn how the algorithm works, or
      to adapt it, or to convert the code to another language, this
      is a real drawback.  This is one reason I still keep a copy
      of LINPACK around.

      Versions of LINPACK in various arithmetic precisions are available
      through <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/">the NETLIB web site</a>.
