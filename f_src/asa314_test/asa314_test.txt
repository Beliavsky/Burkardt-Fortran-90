  INVMOD computes the inverse of a matrix
  whose elements are subject to modulo arithmetic.
 
  The matrix to be inverted:
 
  Col        1       2       3
  Row
 
    1:       1       1       2
    2:       0       1       0
    3:       0       0       1
 
  The computed inverse:
 
  Col        1       2       3
  Row
 
    1:       1       2       1
    2:       0       1       0
    3:       0       0       1
 
  The correct inverse:
 
  Col        1       2       3
  Row
 
    1:       1       2       1
    2:       0       1       0
    3:       0       0       1
 
ASA314_TEST:
  Normal end of execution.
