      REGION <br> Group Voxels into Regions

    <p>
      <b>REGION</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      manipulates 3D voxel data.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of a project, we had to take a file of voxel data representing
      a brain scan.  Each voxel had an integer value representing the intensity
      of a signal.  Only voxels with an intensity above a certain value were
      to be considered.  Those voxels were then grouped into contiguous regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      A further complication was the desire to be able to include an
      enclosing surface image of the brain, project the internal regions
      out along a line from a point to the surface, and mark the surface
      with the color associated with the region.  Some of the routines
      in this package are associated with that task.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple routine called <b>IVOXEL_TO_OBJ</b> allows you to take a
      voxel array and create a corresponding OBJ 3D graphics file.
