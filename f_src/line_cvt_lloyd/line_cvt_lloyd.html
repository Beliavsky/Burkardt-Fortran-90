      LINE_CVT_LLOYD <br> Lloyd's CVT Method for a Line Segment
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINE_CVT_LLOYD</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      carries out Lloyd's iteration for computing a 
      Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation (CVT) of points 
      over the interior of a line segment in 1D.
    </p>

    <p>
      A constraint has been added to the computation, which forces the first
      and last points to be fixed to the endpoints of the line segment. 
      This is not actually a requirement for Lloyd's method. 
    </p>

    <p>
      At least for the uniform density case, the exact solution of this problem
      is known in advance, and is simply a set of equally spaced points.
      For instance, for N = 4, the solution over the interval [0,1] would be
      0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, if the endpoint constraint is imposed.  If the endpoint
      constraint is NOT imposed, then the exact solution is: 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8.
