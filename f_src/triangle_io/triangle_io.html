      <b>TRIANGLE_IO</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can read or write some simple versions of some of the files
      used by Jonathan Shewchuk's triangle() program.

    <p>
      <a href = "../../f_src/fem_to_triangle/fem_to_triangle.html">
      FEM_TO_TRIANGLE</a>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      reads FEM files defining a 2D mesh of triangles, namely
      a file of node coordinates and a file of elements defined by
      node indices, and creates a corresponding pair of node
      and element files for use by Jonathan Shewchuk's triangle() program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../c_src/showme/showme.html">
      SHOWME</a>,
      a C program which
      can display the POLY files uses as input to triangle(),
      and the output files that define meshes and other objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../c_src/triangle/triangle.html">
      TRIANGLE</a>,
      a C program which
      computes Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations,
      and creates and manipulates files that can be displayed by showme().
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../m_src/triangle_display/triangle_display.html">
      TRIANGLE_DISPLAY</a>,
      a MATLAB program which
      displays the nodes and elements of a triangulation
      on the MATLAB graphics screen, assuming the data has been
      stored in NODE and ELE files by the TRIANGLE program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href = "../../data/triangle_files/triangle_files.html">

      a FORTRAN90 code which reads the NODE and ELE files created by triangle() to
      describe a triangular mesh, and writes a corresponding pair of
      node and element files in the 2D FEM format.
