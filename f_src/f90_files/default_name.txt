DEFAULT_NAME:
  FORTRAN90 version.
  The FORTRAN90 open() statement is used to access
  files to be read or written.  Input to the statement
  includes a filename (what the operating system calls
  the file) and a unit number (a numeric identifier
  used by the program, instead of the filename.
 
  The user may omit the filename, in which case
  FORTRAN assumes a default name, based on the unit
  number.  For example, a file associated with unit
  20 might have a default name of "FORT.20" or "fort.20"
 
  The actual default names are not specified by the
  FORTRAN standard and so are dependent on the compiler.
 
  This program opens several anonymous files for writing
  and thus enables the user to figure out the naming
  scheme that is used.
 
  Created the file "fort.8".
  Created the file "fort.11".
  Created the file "fort.34".
  Created the file "fort.99".
 
DEFAULT_NAME:
  Normal end of execution.
