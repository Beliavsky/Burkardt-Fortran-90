      GRAFPACK <br> Graph Computations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>GRAFPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 library which
      performs common calculations involving (abstract mathematical) graphs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes such tasks as a breadth-first-search, the
      computation of a minimum spanning tree,
      an Euler or Hamilton circuit, blocks, chromatic polynomial, or transitive
      closure.  Some algorithms are general, while others apply only to directed
      graphs or trees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the routine names begin with a prefix that indicates the type
      of object it is associated with:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>COLOR_DIGRAPH_ADJ</b> is a directed graph whose nodes are colored;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>COLOR_GRAPH_ADJ</b> is an undirected graph whose nodes are colored;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DIGRAPH_ADJ</b> is a directed graph described by an adjacency matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DIGRAPH_ARC</b> is a directed graph described by an edge list;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FACE</b> is a collection of "faces" defined by circuits in a graph;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GRAPH_ADJ</b> is an undirected graph described by an adjacency matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GRAPH_ARC</b> is an undirected graph described by an edge list;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>GRAPH_DIST</b> is an undirected graph described by a distance matrix;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MAZE</b> is a maze;
        </li>
      </ul>
