      <b>persistence</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      demonstrates how to initialize, get, or set data stored
      within a function, using static/persistent/saved/local memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      This type of data storage is sometimes referred to as "static memory"
      or "persistent memory" or "saved memory".
    </p>

    <p>
      Several examples are offered here, each embodied in a function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          constants() stores the value of three physical constants,
          and returns them.  It is not very ambitious.
        </li>
        <li>
          abc() stores the value of three real numbers, which are
          initialized to 1, 2, and 3.  The user can request the current
          values, or request that they be printed, or can set them to
          new values.
        </li>
        <li>
          stats() accepts, one at a time, a sequence of real numbers.
          It internally updates the sum, min, mean, max, variance
          and standard deviation of the entire sequence, and can report
          the current values of these quantities at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          byname() internally stores three variables.  The user can access
          any one of these variables, by naming the kind of access,
          naming the variable to be accessed, and the new value if any, to
          be assigned to it.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
