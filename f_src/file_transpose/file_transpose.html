    <p>
      <b>FILE_TRANSPOSE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      creates a "transposed" copy of a file, in which, essentially, the I-th
      word of the J-th line becomes the J-th word of the I-th line.
    </p>

    <h3 align = "center">
      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>file_transpose</b> <i>input</i> <i>output</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>input</i> is the name of the input file,
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>output</i> is the name of the output file to be created.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if the input file is:
      <pre>
        Apple Ball    Carrot Doll
         Egg    Fig  1.23456,  Haystack
        Iodine 
               Joystick Kahlua Lompoc     Millipede Negatory
      </pre>
      the transposed file will be:
      <pre>
        Apple Egg Iodine Joystick
        Ball Fig Kahlua
        Carrot 1.23456, Lompoc
        Doll Haystack Millipede
        Negatory
      </pre>
    </p>
