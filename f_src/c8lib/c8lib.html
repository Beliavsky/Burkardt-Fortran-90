      C8LIB <br> A Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Utility Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>c8lib</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      implements certain
      elementary functions for double precision complex (C8) variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The symbol "C8" is used to suggest a double precision complex
      variable.  Here the 8 indicates that the underlying pair of
      real numbers each use 8 bytes of storage.
    </p>

    <p>
      C8LIB contains routines that operate on scalars, vectors or
      doubly dimensioned arrays of C8's.  A vector of C8's is denoted
      a C8VEC, and a doubly dimensioned array is a C8MAT.
