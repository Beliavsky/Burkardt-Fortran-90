program main

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! MAIN is the main program for FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE_TEST.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE_TEST tests the FILE_NAME_SEQUENCE library.
!
!    There are situations such as animations or parallel processing in which
!    it is necessary to generate a sequence of file names which include
!    an embedded index that increases.  A simple example might be
!
!      "fred0.txt", "fred1.txt", "fred2.txt"
!
!    A side issue arises when the number of files is large enough that the
!    number of digits in the index will vary.  Thus, if we are going to have
!    15 files, do we want to number them as
!
!      "fred00.txt" through "fred14.txt"
!
!    which means, for one thing, that they will alphabetize properly, or
!    will we be satisfied with
!
!      "fred0.txt" through "fred14.txt" ?
