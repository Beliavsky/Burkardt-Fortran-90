    <p>
      <b>FD1D_ADVECTION_FTCS</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      applies the finite difference method to solve the time-dependent
      advection equation ut = - c * ux in one spatial dimension, with
      a constant velocity, using the FTCS method, forward time difference,
      centered space difference, writing graphics files for processing by gnuplot.
    </p>

    <p>
      We solve the constant-velocity advection equation in 1D,
      <pre>
        du/dt = - c du/dx
      </pre>
      over the interval:
      <pre>
        0.0 <= x <= 1.0
      </pre>
      with periodic boundary conditions, and
      with a given initial condition
      <pre>
        u(0,x) = (10x-4)^2 (6-10x)^2 for 0.4 <= x <= 0.6
               = 0 elsewhere.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We use a method known as FTCS:
      <ul>
        <li>
          FT: Forward Time  : du/dt = (u(t+dt,x)-u(t,x))/dt
        </li>
        <li>
          CS: Centered Space: du/dx = (u(t,x+dx)-u(t,x-dx))/2/dx
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The FTCS method is <i>unstable</i> for the advection problem.
      One purpose of this example is to demonstrate that fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our simple case, the advection velocity is constant
      in time and space.  Therefore, (given our periodic boundary conditions),
      the solution should simply move smoothly from left to right, returning
      on the left again.  Instead, because of the instabilities, we see
      that the solution quickly becomes dominated by erroneous oscillations.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are more sophisticated methods for the advection problem,
      which do not exhibit this behavior.
