    <p>
      <b>include_files</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      makes a copy of a FORTRAN file, in which INCLUDE statements
      are replaced by the corresponding include files.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format for a FORTRAN include statement is either
      <pre><b>
        <b>include</b> '<i>file.txt</i>'
      </b></pre>
      or
      <pre><b>
        <b>include</b> "<i>file.txt</i>"
      </b></pre>
      This program reads a file with such include statements, and
      replaces each such occurrence by the text of the corresponding file.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>include_files</b> <i>file1.f</i> <i>file2.f</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          reads the file <i>file1.f</i> and creates a copy <i>file2.f</i>
          with all available INCLUDE files included.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>include_files</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          asks the user for the names of the files <i>file1.f</i> and
          <i>file2.f</i>.
        </dd>

      a C++ program which
      reads a C, C++, FORTRAN77 or FORTRAN90 code and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.
