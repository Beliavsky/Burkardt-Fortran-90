      Approximate Fekete Points in an Interval
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LINE_FEKETE_RULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      approximates the location of Fekete points in an interval [A,B].
      A family of sets of Fekete points, indexed by size N, represents
      an excellent choice for defining a polynomial interpolant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a desired number of points N, the best choice for abscissas is
      a set of Lebesgue points, which minimize the Lebesgue constant,
      which describes the error in polynomial interpolation.  Sets of
      Lebesgue points are difficult to define mathematically.  Fekete
      points are a related, computable set, defined as those sets maximizing
      the magnitude of the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix associated
      with the points.  Analytic definitions of these points are known for
      a few cases, but there is a general computational procedure for 
      approximating them, which is demonstrated here.
