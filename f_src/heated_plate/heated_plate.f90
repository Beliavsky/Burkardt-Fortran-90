!
!! MAIN is the main program for HEATED_PLATE.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This code solves the steady state heat equation on a rectangular region.
!
!    The sequential version of this program needs approximately
!    18/eps iterations to complete. 
!
!
!    The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
!    by this diagram;
!
!                   W = 0
!             +------------------+
!             |                  |
!    W = 100  |                  | W = 100
!             |                  |
!             +------------------+
!                   W = 100
!
!    The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
!    array W is used to record the temperature.  The correspondence between
!    array indices and locations in the region is suggested by giving the
!    indices of the four corners:
!
!                  I = 0
!          [0][0]-------------[0][N-1]
!             |                  |
!      J = 0  |                  |  J = N-1
!             |                  |
!        [M-1][0]-----------[M-1][N-1]
!                  I = M-1
!
!    The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
!    following condition at an interior grid point:
!
!      W[Central] = (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
!
!    where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
!    of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.
!   
!    Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
!    "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
!    average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
!    as an ASSIGNMENT statement:
!
!      W[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( W[North] + W[South] + W[East] + W[West] )
!
!    If this process is repeated often enough, the difference between 
!    successive estimates of the solution will go to zero.
!
!    This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
!    the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
!    be used for graphic processing.
