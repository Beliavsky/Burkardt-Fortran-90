LAGUERRE_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Gauss-Laguerre rule for approximating
    Integral ( a <= x < +oo ) exp(-b*(x-a)) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, A, B, and FILENAME:
  ORDER is the number of points in the rule.
  A is the left endpoint, (typically 0).
  B is the scale factor, (typically 1).
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
  * filename_w.txt - the weight file
  * filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  * filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =        4
  A =    0.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "lag_o4".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "lag_o4".
 
  Weight file will be   "lag_o4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "lag_o4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "lag_o4_r.txt".
 
LAGUERRE_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.
