 
HEAT_MPI:
  FORTRAN90/MPI version.
  Solve the 1D time-dependent heat equation.
 
  Compute an approximate solution to the time dependent
  one dimensional heat equation:
 
    dH/dt - K * d2H/dx2 = f(x,t)
 
  for    0.00000     = x_min < x < x_max =    1.00000    
 
  and    0.00000     = time_min < t <= t_max =    10.0000    
 
  Boundary conditions are specified at x_min and x_max.
  Initial conditions are specified at time_min.
 
  The finite difference method is used to discretize
  the differential equation.
 
  This uses       88 equally spaced points in X
  and      400 equally spaced points in time.
 
  Parallel execution is done using        8 processors.
  Domain decomposition is used.
  Each processor works on       11 nodes,
  and shares some information with its immediate neighbors.
 
UPDATE
  CFL stability criterion value =   0.378450    
 
  Wall clock elapsed seconds =   0.478504E-02
