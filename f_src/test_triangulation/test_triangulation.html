    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TEST_TRIANGULATION</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      sets up a number of triangulation test problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      As far as possible, a uniform and abstract approach has been used.
      For each test region, a number of routines are provided, via which
      it is possible for the user to determine many things about the region.
      Often, just one or two routines would be needed for a particular
      purpose.  The names of the routines, and their purposes are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>BOUNDARY_NEAREST:</b> returns the nearest point on the boundary
          of the region to a given point or set of points;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BOUNDARY_PROJECT:</b> projects exterior points onto the boundary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BOUNDARY_SEGMENT:</b> returns a sequence of roughly equally spaced
          points that lie on one particular boundary segment;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BOUNDARY_SEGMENT_LENGTH:</b> returns the "length" (number of
          nodes) of a particular boundary segment.  This simply counts
          the number of points needed to trace or approximate the
          boundary segment;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BOUNDARY_SEGMENT_NUM:</b> returns the number of boundary segments.
          Simple regions have one boundary segment.  A region with one hole
          has two, and so on;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>BOX:</b> returns a bounding box for the region.  All points in
          the region are within this box;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DENSITY:</b> the value of the mesh density function at any
          point in the region.  If this is not constant, then high values
          correspond to places where many more mesh points should be placed;
          is always 2 for this set;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ELEMENT_SIZE:</b> returns a requested typical element size.  This
          refers to the average size of the triangles formed by a triangulation
          of the points;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FIXED_NUM:</b> returns the number of points which must be
          included as nodes of the mesh (which may be zero);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FIXED_POINTS:</b> returns the coordinates of the points which
          must be included as nodes of the mesh;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HEADER:</b> prints a brief description of the problem;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HOLE_NUM:</b> returns the number of "holes" in the region;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HOLE_POINT:</b> returns the coordinates of one point in a hole
          (useful when TRIANGLE is to be invoked);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>INSIDE:</b> reports which of a given set of points are
          inside the region.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SAMPLE:</b> returns a set of sample points from the region,
          chosen with uniform probability;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SAMPLE_H1:</b> returns a set of sample points from the region,
          after it has been enlarged by an amount H1;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SDIST:</b> returns the signed distance to the boundary of
          the region for each of a set of input points.
          (a positive distance means the point is outside the region,
           a negative distance means it is inside);
          <i>(Not ready for problems 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 )</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>TITLE:</b> a title for the problem;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The test problems include:
