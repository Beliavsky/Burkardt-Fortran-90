      <b>gen_hermite_exactness</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 program which
      investigates the polynomial exactness of a generalized Gauss-Hermite
      quadrature rule for the infinite interval (-oo,+oo).
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>
        Note that the arithmetic accuracy of this program may be insufficient
        to discriminant the accuracy of generalized Gauss-Hermite rules of moderate
        order - say, order 16.  Therefore, a FORTRAN90 version of this program
        has been prepared,  using "quadruple precision", which should give more
        satisfactory results for a wider range of orders.  This program can
        be found cataloged below as <b>gen_hermite_exactness_R16</b>.

      Standard generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature assumes that the integrand we are
      considering has a form like:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) |x|^alpha * exp(-x^2) * f(x) dx
      </pre>
      where the factor <b>|x|^alpha * exp(-x^2)</b> is regarded as a weight factor.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>standard generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule</i> is a set of <b>n</b>
      positive weights <b>w</b> and abscissas <b>x</b> so that
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) |x|^alpha * exp(-x^2) * f(x) dx
      </pre>
      may be approximated by
      <pre>
        Sum ( 1 &lt;= I &lt;= N ) w(i) * f(x(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is often convenient to consider approximating integrals in which
      the weighting factor <b>|x|^alpha * exp(-x^2)</b> is implicit.  In that case, we
      are looking at approximating
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
      and it is easy to modify a standard generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule
      to handle this case directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <i>modified generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule</i> is a set of <b>n</b>
      positive weights <b>w</b> and abscissas <b>x</b> so that
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
      may be approximated by
      <pre>
        Sum ( 1 &lt;= I &lt;= N ) w(i) * f(x(i))
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      When using a generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule, it's important to know whether
      the rule has been developed for the standard or modified cases.
      Basically, the only change is that the weights of the modified rule have
      been divided by the weighting function evaluated at the corresponding abscissa.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a standard generalized Gauss-Hermite rule, polynomial exactness is defined in terms of
      the function <b>f(x)</b>.  That is, we say the rule is exact for polynomials
      up to degree DEGREE_MAX if, for any polynomial <b>f(x)</b> of that degree or
      less, the quadrature rule will produce the exact value of
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) |x|^alpha * exp(-x^2) * f(x) dx
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      For a modified generalized Gauss-Hermite rule, polynomial exactness is defined in terms of
      the function <b>f(x)</b> divided by the implicit weighting function.  That is,
      we say a modified generalized Gauss-Hermite rule is exact for polynomials up to degree
      DEGREE_MAX if, for any integrand <b>f(x)</b> with the property that
      <b>f(x)/(|x|^alpha*exp(-x^2))</b> is a polynomial of degree no more than DEGREE_MAX,
      the quadrature rule will product the exact value of:
      <pre>
        Integral ( -oo &lt; x &lt; +oo ) f(x) dx
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program starts at <b>DEGREE</b> = 0, and then
      proceeds to <b>DEGREE</b> = 1, 2, and so on up to a maximum degree
      <b>DEGREE_MAX</b> specified by the user.  At each value of <b>DEGREE</b>,
      the program generates the corresponding monomial term, applies the
      quadrature rule to it, and determines the quadrature error.  The program
      uses a scaling factor on each monomial so that the exact integral
      should always be 1; therefore, each reported error can be compared
      on a fixed scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the program understands that the rule being considered is a modified rule,
      then the monomials are multiplied by <b>|x|^alpha * exp(-x^2)</b> when performing the
      exactness test.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is very flexible and interactive.  The quadrature rule
      is defined by three files, to be read at input, and the
      maximum degree top be checked is specified by the user as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the three files that define the quadrature rule
      are assumed to have related names, of the form
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>x.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>w.txt</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>r.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      When running the program, the user only enters the common <i>prefix</i>
      part of the file names, which is enough information for the program
      to find all three files.
    </p>

    <p>
      For information on the form of these files, see the
      <b>QUADRATURE_RULES</b> directory listed below.
    </p>

    <p>
      The exactness results are written to an output file with the
      corresponding name:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_<b>exact.txt</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>gen_hermite_exactness</b> <i>prefix</i> <i>degree_max</i> <i>alpha</i> <i>option</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i> is the common prefix for the files containing the abscissa, weight
          and region information of the quadrature rule;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>degree_max</i> is the maximum monomial degree to check.  This would normally be
          a relatively small nonnegative number, such as 5, 10 or 15.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>alpha</i> is the value of the parameter, which should be a real number greater than -1.0.
          Setting <i>alpha</i> to 0.0 results in the basic (non-generalized) Gauss-Hermite rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>option</i>:<br>
          0 indicates a standard rule for integrating |x|^alpha * exp(-x^2)*f(x).<br>
          1 indicates a modified rule for integrating f(x).
        </li>
      </ul>

      If the arguments are not supplied on the command line, the
      program will prompt for them.
