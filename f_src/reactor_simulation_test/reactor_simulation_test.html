    <p>
      <b>reactor_simulation_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls reactor_simulation(), which
      simulates the shielding effect of a slab intended to absorb
      or reflect most of the radiation from a neutron source.
      This program is intended as a simple demonstration of Monte Carlo
      simulation as applied to the analysis of complicated probabilistic
      systems.
