!! MAIN is the main program for FEM1D_NONLINEAR.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    FEM1D_NONLINLEAR solves a nonlinear one dimensional boundary value problem.
!
!    The differential equation has the form:
!
!      -d/dx (p(x) du/dx) + q(x)*u +u*u' =  f(x)
!
!    The finite-element method uses piecewise linear basis functions.
!
!    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
!    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
!
!    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
!
!    Sample problem #1:
!
!    u(x)  = x,
!    p(x)  = 1,
!    q(x)  = 0,
!    f(x)  = x,
!    u(0)  = 0,
!    u'(1) = 1.
!    The code should solve this problem exactly.
!
!    Sample problem #2:
!
!    u(x)  = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi,
!    p(x)  = 1,
!    q(x)  = 0,
!    f(x)  = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
!    u(0)  = 0,
!    u'(1) = 1.

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ADIAG(NU).
!    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
!    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ALEFT(NU).
!    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
!    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
!    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) ARITE(NU).
!    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
!    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
!    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
!    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) F(NU).
!    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
!    equations.
!    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
!    linear equations.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) FOLD(NU).
!    FOLD contains the value of F from the previous iteration,
!    and is used in ASSEMBLE to add correction terms to the
!    matrix and right hand side.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) H(N), the length of the subintervals.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) IBC.
!    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
!    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
!    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
!       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
!    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
!       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) IMAX.
!    The number of Newton iterations to carry out.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) INDX(0:N).
!    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
!    associated with node I.
!    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
!    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
!    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
!    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
!    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
!    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NL.
!    The number of basis functions used in a single
!    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
!    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
!    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NODE(NL,N).
!    For each subinterval I:
!    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
!    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NPRINT.
!    The number of points at which the computed solution
!    should be printed out when compared to the exact solution.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NQUAD.
!    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
!    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) N.
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval
!    [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) NU.
!    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
!    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
!    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
!    of basis functions.
!
!    integer ( kind = 4 ) PROBLEM, indicates which problem to be solved.
!    * 1, u = x, p=1, q=0, f=x, u(0)=0, u'(1)=1.
!    * 2, u = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, p=1, q=0,
!    f = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
!    u(0) = 0, u'(1)=1.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) UL.
!    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) UR.
!    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XL.
!    XL is the left endpoint of the interval over which the
!    differential equation is being solved.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XN(0:N).
!    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
!    and XN(N) is XR.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XQUAD(N)
!    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
!    in interval I.
!
!    real ( kind = 8 ) XR.
!    XR is the right endpoint of the interval over which the
!    differential equation is being solved.

!
!! ASSEMBLE_NEWTON assembles the Newton linear system.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    The linear system being solved here is for the Newton correction
!    to an approximate solution of a nonlinear system.
!
!    Thus, we suppose that we have a nonlinear function F(X),
!    and an approximate solution X0.  If we can suppose there is an
!    exact solution X* that is "nearby", and in fact close enough
!    that Taylor's theorem gives us a useful estimate, then we
!    may write:
!
!      F(X*) = F(X0) + F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) + Order ( X* - X0 )^2
!
!    and by rearranging, we get the Newton system (which is only
!    approximately correct):
!
!      F'(X0) * ( X* - X0 ) = - F(X0)
!
!    We solve this system and add the solution to X0 to get a
!    new approximate solution that, we hope, is much improved.

!    The equation we are trying to solve has the form:
!
!      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u + u * u' = f(x)
!
!    For the Picard iteration, we need to modify the nonlinear term u * u'
!    so that it is linear in the unknown u, and any other factors of u are

!
!  Parameters:
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ADIAG(NU).
!    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
!    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ALEFT(NU).
!    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
!    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
!    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
!    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) ARITE(NU).
!    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
!    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
!    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
!    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
!    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
!
!    Output, real ( kind = 8 ) F(NU), the right hand side of the linear
!    equations.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) H(N), the length of the subintervals.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) INDX(0:N).
!    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
!    associated with node I.
!    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
!    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
!    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
!    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
!    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
!    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
!    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) N.
!    The number of subintervals into which the interval
!    [XL,XR] is broken.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NL.
!    The number of basis functions used in a single
!    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
!    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
!    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NODE(NL,N).
!    For each subinterval I:
!    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
!    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NQUAD.
!    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
!    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) NU.
!    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
!    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
!    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
!    of basis functions.
!
!    Input, integer ( kind = 4 ) PROBLEM, indicates which problem to be solved.
!    * 1, u = x, p=1, q=0, f=x, u(0)=0, u'(1)=1.
!    * 2, u = 2*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x))/pi, p=1, q=0,
!    f = -0.5*pi*cos(0.5*pi*x) + 2*sin(0.5*pi*x)*(1-cos(0.5*pi*x)/pi
!    u(0) = 0, u'(1)=1.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) U(NU), the solution value
!    from the previous iteration,
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) UL.
!    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XL.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) UR.
!    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
!    to have at X = XR.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) XN(0:N).
!    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(0) is XL,
!    and XN(N) is XR.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) XQUAD(N)
!    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
!    in interval I.
