LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Legendre
  quadrature rule by integrating 
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.
 
LEGENDRE_EXACTNESS: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "leg_o4_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "leg_o4_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "leg_o4_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check =       10
 
  Spatial dimension =        1
  Number of points  =        4
 
  The quadrature rule to be tested is
  a Gauss-Legendre rule
  ORDER =        4
 
  Standard rule:
    Integral ( -1 <= x <= +1 ) f(x) dx
    is to be approximated by
    sum ( 1 <= I <= ORDER ) w(i) * f(x(i)).
 
  Weights W:
 
  w( 1) =   0.3478548451374539    
  w( 2) =   0.6521451548625459    
  w( 3) =   0.6521451548625459    
  w( 4) =   0.3478548451374539    
 
  Abscissas X:
 
  x( 1) =  -0.8611363115940526    
  x( 2) =  -0.3399810435848563    
  x( 3) =   0.3399810435848563    
  x( 4) =   0.8611363115940526    
 
  Region R:
 
  r( 1) =   -1.000000000000000    
  r( 2) =    1.000000000000000    
 
  A Gauss-Legendre rule would be able to exactly
  integrate monomials up to and including degree =        7
