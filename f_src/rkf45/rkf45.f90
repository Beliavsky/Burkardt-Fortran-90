!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! R4_RKF45 carries out the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (single precision).
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This routine is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
!    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
!    It should generally not be used when the user is demanding
!    high accuracy.
!
!    This routine integrates a system of NEQN first-order ordinary differential
!    equations of the form:
!
!      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
!
!    where the Y(1:NEQN) are given at T.
!
!    Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
!    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
!    single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
!    the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
!    only to call again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).
!
!    Before the first call, the user must 
!
!    * supply the subroutine F(T,Y,YP) to evaluate the right hand side;
!      and declare F in an EXTERNAL statement;
!
!    * initialize the parameters:
!      NEQN, Y(1:NEQN), T, TOUT, RELERR, ABSERR, FLAG.
!      In particular, T should initially be the starting point for integration,
!      Y should be the value of the initial conditions, and FLAG should 
!      normally be +1.
!
!    Normally, the user only sets the value of FLAG before the first call, and
!    thereafter, the program manages the value.  On the first call, FLAG should
!    normally be +1 (or -1 for single step mode.)  On normal return, FLAG will
!    have been reset by the program to the value of 2 (or -2 in single 
!    step mode), and the user can continue to call the routine with that 
!    value of FLAG.
!
!    (When the input magnitude of FLAG is 1, this indicates to the program 
!    that it is necessary to do some initialization work.  An input magnitude
!    of 2 lets the program know that that initialization can be skipped, 
!    and that useful information was computed earlier.)
!
!    The routine returns with all the information needed to continue
!    the integration.  If the integration reached TOUT, the user need only
!    define a new TOUT and call again.  In the one-step integrator
!    mode, returning with FLAG = -2, the user must keep in mind that 
!    each step taken is in the direction of the current TOUT.  Upon 
!    reaching TOUT, indicated by the output value of FLAG switching to 2,
!    the user must define a new TOUT and reset FLAG to -2 to continue 
!    in the one-step integrator mode.
!
!    In some cases, an error or difficulty occurs during a call.  In that case,
!    the output value of FLAG is used to indicate that there is a problem
!    that the user must address.  These values include:
!
!    * 3, integration was not completed because the input value of RELERR, the 
!      relative error tolerance, was too small.  RELERR has been increased 
!      appropriately for continuing.  If the user accepts the output value of
!      RELERR, then simply reset FLAG to 2 and continue.
!
!    * 4, integration was not completed because more than MAXNFE derivative 
!      evaluations were needed.  This is approximately (MAXNFE/6) steps.
!      The user may continue by simply calling again.  The function counter 
!      will be reset to 0, and another MAXNFE function evaluations are allowed.
!
!    * 5, integration was not completed because the solution vanished, 
!      making a pure relative error test impossible.  The user must use 
!      a non-zero ABSERR to continue.  Using the one-step integration mode 
!      for one step is a good way to proceed.
!
!    * 6, integration was not completed because the requested accuracy 
!      could not be achieved, even using the smallest allowable stepsize. 
!      The user must increase the error tolerances ABSERR or RELERR before
!      continuing.  It is also necessary to reset FLAG to 2 (or -2 when 
!      the one-step integration mode is being used).  The occurrence of 
!      FLAG = 6 indicates a trouble spot.  The solution is changing 
!      rapidly, or a singularity may be present.  It often is inadvisable 
!      to continue.
!
!    * 7, it is likely that this routine is inefficient for solving
!      this problem.  Too much output is restricting the natural stepsize
!      choice.  The user should use the one-step integration mode with 
!      the stepsize determined by the code.  If the user insists upon 
!      continuing the integration, reset FLAG to 2 before calling 
!      again.  Otherwise, execution will be terminated.
!
!    * 8, invalid input parameters, indicates one of the following:
!      NEQN <= 0;
!      T = TOUT and |FLAG| /= 1;
!      RELERR < 0 or ABSERR < 0;
!      FLAG == 0  or FLAG < -2 or 8 < FLAG.

!    variable.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 4 ) TOUT, the output point at which solution is
!    desired.  TOUT = T is allowed on the first call only, in which case 
!    the routine returns with FLAG = 2 if continuation is possible.
!
!    Input, real ( kind = 4 ) RELERR, ABSERR, the relative and absolute 
!    error tolerances for the local error test.  At each step the code
!    requires:
!      abs ( local error ) <= RELERR * abs ( Y ) + ABSERR
!    for each component of the local error and the solution vector Y.
!    RELERR cannot be "too small".  If the routine believes RELERR has been
!    set too small, it will reset RELERR to an acceptable value and return
!    immediately for user action.
!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) FLAG, indicator for status of 
!    integration.  On the first call, set FLAG to +1 for normal use, or to 
!    -1 for single step mode.  On return, a value of 2 or -2 indicates normal 
!    progress, while any other value indicates a problem that should be 
!    addressed.

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! R8_RKF45 carries out the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (double precision).
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This routine is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
!    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
!    It should generally not be used when the user is demanding
!    high accuracy.
!
!    This routine integrates a system of NEQN first-order ordinary differential
!    equations of the form:
!
!      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
!
!    where the Y(1:NEQN) are given at T.
!
!    Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
!    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
!    single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
!    the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
!    only to call again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).
!
!    Before the first call, the user must
!
!    * supply the subroutine F(T,Y,YP) to evaluate the right hand side;
!      and declare F in an EXTERNAL statement;
!
!    * initialize the parameters:
!      NEQN, Y(1:NEQN), T, TOUT, RELERR, ABSERR, FLAG.
!      In particular, T should initially be the starting point for integration,
!      Y should be the value of the initial conditions, and FLAG should
!      normally be +1.
!
!    Normally, the user only sets the value of FLAG before the first call, and
!    thereafter, the program manages the value.  On the first call, FLAG should
!    normally be +1 (or -1 for single step mode.)  On normal return, FLAG will
!    have been reset by the program to the value of 2 (or -2 in single
!    step mode), and the user can continue to call the routine with that
!    value of FLAG.
!
!    (When the input magnitude of FLAG is 1, this indicates to the program
!    that it is necessary to do some initialization work.  An input magnitude
!    of 2 lets the program know that that initialization can be skipped,
!    and that useful information was computed earlier.)
!
!    The routine returns with all the information needed to continue
!    the integration.  If the integration reached TOUT, the user need only
!    define a new TOUT and call again.  In the one-step integrator
!    mode, returning with FLAG = -2, the user must keep in mind that
!    each step taken is in the direction of the current TOUT.  Upon
!    reaching TOUT, indicated by the output value of FLAG switching to 2,
!    the user must define a new TOUT and reset FLAG to -2 to continue
!    in the one-step integrator mode.
!
!    In some cases, an error or difficulty occurs during a call.  In that case,
!    the output value of FLAG is used to indicate that there is a problem
!    that the user must address.  These values include:
!
!    * 3, integration was not completed because the input value of RELERR, the
!      relative error tolerance, was too small.  RELERR has been increased
!      appropriately for continuing.  If the user accepts the output value of
!      RELERR, then simply reset FLAG to 2 and continue.
!
!    * 4, integration was not completed because more than MAXNFE derivative
!      evaluations were needed.  This is approximately (MAXNFE/6) steps.
!      The user may continue by simply calling again.  The function counter
!      will be reset to 0, and another MAXNFE function evaluations are allowed.
!
!    * 5, integration was not completed because the solution vanished,
!      making a pure relative error test impossible.  The user must use
!      a non-zero ABSERR to continue.  Using the one-step integration mode
!      for one step is a good way to proceed.
!
!    * 6, integration was not completed because the requested accuracy
!      could not be achieved, even using the smallest allowable stepsize.
!      The user must increase the error tolerances ABSERR or RELERR before
!      continuing.  It is also necessary to reset FLAG to 2 (or -2 when
!      the one-step integration mode is being used).  The occurrence of
!      FLAG = 6 indicates a trouble spot.  The solution is changing
!      rapidly, or a singularity may be present.  It often is inadvisable
!      to continue.
!
!    * 7, it is likely that this routine is inefficient for solving
!      this problem.  Too much output is restricting the natural stepsize
!      choice.  The user should use the one-step integration mode with
!      the stepsize determined by the code.  If the user insists upon
!      continuing the integration, reset FLAG to 2 before calling
!      again.  Otherwise, execution will be terminated.
!
!    * 8, invalid input parameters, indicates one of the following:
!      NEQN <= 0;
!      T = TOUT and |FLAG| /= 1;
!      RELERR < 0 or ABSERR < 0;
!      FLAG == 0  or FLAG < -2 or 8 < FLAG.

!
!    Input, real ( kind = 8 ) RELERR, ABSERR, the relative and absolute

!    requires:
!      abs ( local error ) <= RELERR * abs ( Y ) + ABSERR
!    for each component of the local error and the solution vector Y.
!    RELERR cannot be "too small".  If the routine believes RELERR has been

!
!    Input/output, integer ( kind = 4 ) FLAG, indicator for status of 
!    integration.  On the first call, set FLAG to +1 for normal use, or to -1 
!    for single step mode.  On return, a value of 2 or -2 indicates normal 
!    progress, while any other value indicates a problem that should 
!    be addressed.

!  Here begins the core integrator for taking a single step.
!
!  The tolerances have been scaled to avoid premature underflow in
!  computing the error tolerance function ET.
!  To avoid problems with zero crossings, relative error is measured
!  using the average of the magnitudes of the solution at the
!  beginning and end of a step.
!  The error estimate formula has been grouped to control loss of
!  significance.
!
!  To distinguish the various arguments, H is not permitted
!  to become smaller than 26 units of roundoff in T.
!  Practical limits on the change in the stepsize are enforced to
!  smooth the stepsize selection process and to avoid excessive
!  chattering on problems having discontinuities.
!  To prevent unnecessary failures, the code uses 9/10 the stepsize
!  it estimates will succeed.
!
!  After a step failure, the stepsize is not allowed to increase for
!  the next attempted step.  This makes the code more efficient on
!  problems having discontinuities and more effective in general
!  since local extrapolation is being used and extra caution seems
!  warranted.
!
!  Test the number of derivative function evaluations.
!  If okay, try to advance the integration from T to T+H.
