      JACOBI_OPENMP <br> Jacobi Iteration using OpenMP
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>JACOBI_OPENMP</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      uses the OpenMP application program interface
      to parallelize a Jacobi iteration solving A*x=b.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each step of the Jacobi iteration produces a vector xnew.
      The i-th entry of xnew is found by ``solving'' the i-th linear
      equation for the i-th variable.  This operation can be done
      in parallel.  It is a little more complicated to compute
      the maximum difference between the old and new x values, and
      to compute the maximum residual, but these can be done.
    </p>

    <p>
      The example uses a standard -1,2,-1 matrix which has very slow
      convergence.  Here, the point is not so much to get the answer,
      but to show that the process can be speeded up by employing OpenMP.
