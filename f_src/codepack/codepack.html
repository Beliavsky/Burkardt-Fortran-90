      CODEPACK <br> Graph Codes
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CODEPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes and compares "codes" for graphs, directed graphs, multigraphs,
      and other generalizations of an abstract graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      The codes are a form of "signature".  Two graphs are
      isomorphic (essentially the same object) if and only if their signatures
      are equal.  The codes are numeric, and hence determining whether
      two graphs are isomorphic is reduced to the problem of whether two
      sequences of integers are identical.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to understand that the kind of problem being
      considered here is HARD and EXPENSIVE.  The time and space
      requirements increase very rapidly as the number of nodes in
      the graph increase.  Graphs with 10 nodes can be handled, but
      graphs with 20 nodes may be difficult, and graphs with 40 or
      50 nodes may be impossible to handle.  This is partly because
      we are looking at permutations of the nodes, and this number grows
      as the factorial function.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although graph codes are expensive to compute, it is often not
      difficult to detect that two graphs are not isomorphic.
      A determination can be made very quickly if the number of nodes,
      number of edges, or the degree sequence does not match.  These
      techniques can often produce a "No" answer quickly.  But if two
      graphs do happen to be isomorphic, then there is no rapid way
      to determine this.  The only thing a graph code offers is a
      systematic (but slow) way to go about this computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kinds of graphs considered here include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Graphs</i> in which any two nodes may or may not be connected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Digraphs</i> or "directed graphs", in which the edges between
          two nodes have a direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Color graphs</i> in which each node has a color.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Multigraphs</i> in which the number of (undirected) edges between
          two nodes may be more than 1; this may also be thought of as a
          single edge with an integer weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Weighted graphs</i> in which each (undirected) edge is assigned
          a (real number) weight, or distance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Other kinds of graphs can have various combinations of these properties.
      For instance, we are interested in <i>color dimultigraphs</I>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of the routine names begin with a prefix that indicates the type
      of object it is associated with:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>G</b> is a graph;
        </li>
       <li>
          <b>DG</b> is a directed graph (edges have a direction);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CG</b> is a color graph (nodes have a color);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MG</b> is a multigraph (edges have multiplicity);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CDG</b> is a color directed graph (edges have direction,
          nodes have a color);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>DMG</b> is a dimultigraph (edges have direction and multiplicity);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CDMG</b> is a color dimultigraph (edges have direction and
          multiplicity, nodes have color);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>WG</b> is a weighted graph;
        </li>
      </ul>
