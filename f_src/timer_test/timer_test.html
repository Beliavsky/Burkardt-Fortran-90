    <p>
      <b>timer_test</b>
      FORTRAN90 codes which
      examine methods for computing
      the elapsed CPU time of a part of a calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is that you want to
      determine the amount of CPU time taken by a piece of your code, so
      you write lines like this:
      <pre><tt>
        call timer ( t1 )
        do i = 1, n
          ...some big calculation...
        end do
        call timer ( t2 )
        write ( *, * ) 'Elapsed CPU time = ', t2 - t1
      </pre></tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      Early versions of FORTRAN did not specify a standard way to access
      a system timer. Users on UNIX systems
      could access a system library routine called ETIME for this purpose,
      but ETIME was not part of the FORTRAN language, and was not to be found on
      other operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      FORTRAN90 added the SYSTEM_CLOCK function which can measure real time:
      <pre><tt>
        call system_clock ( t1, clock_rate, clock_max )
        do i = 1, n
          ...some big calculation...
        end do
        call system_clock ( t2, clock_rate, clock_max )
        write ( *, * ) 'Elapsed real time = ', real ( t2 - t1 ) / real ( clock_rate )
      </pre></tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      FORTRAN95 added the CPU_TIME function which measures CPU time:
      <pre><tt>
        call cpu_time ( t1 )
        do i = 1, n
          ...some big calculation...
        end do
        call cpu_time ( t2 )
        write ( *, * ) 'Elapsed CPU time = ', t2 - t1
      </pre></tt>
    </p>

    <p>
      On various
      computers, there are often vendor-supplied routines to do this chore.
      You will often find that the timer is inaccurate; some operations will
      be reported as taking zero time; other operations will be reported
      with times that differ by 5 or 10 percent.  Moreover, two timers that
      profess to measure the same thing may produce results that are
      consistently different by a factor of 40 percent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another problem is "wrap around".  Many timers reach a maximum value,
      and then reset themselves to zero.  If this happens to you, (it's
      happened to me many times!) you may find that a certain procedure
      seems to take negative time!
    </p>

    <p>
      Some timers return CPU time, that is, the amount of elapsed computer
      time that was used by your program; other routines return "real" time
      or "wall clock" time, which will not account for situations in which
      your program started, and then was paused for some reason (swapped out,
      waiting for I/O, or other system functions), and then finished.
    </p>

    <p>
      For parallel programming, the important thing to measure is the elapsed
      wallclock time.  This can be found by subtracting an initial reading of
      the wallclock time from a final one.
    </p>

    <p>
      The OpenMP system provides a function used as follows:
      <pre>
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( )
        operations to time;
        seconds = omp_get_wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      while the MPI system provides a similar function used as:
      <pre>
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( );
        operations;
        seconds = MPI_Wtime ( ) - seconds;
      </pre>
      and in MATLAB, wallclock time can be taken with "tic" and "toc":
      <pre>
        tic;
        operation;
        seconds = toc;
      </pre>
    </p>
