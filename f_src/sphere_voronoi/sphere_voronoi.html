      SPHERE_VORONOI <br> Voronoi Diagram on Unit Sphere
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_VORONOI</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes and plots the  Voronoi diagram of points on the unit sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      SPHERE_VORONOI takes as input an XYZ file, containing
      coordinates of points on the unit sphere in 3D.
      It passes this data to Renka's  STRIPACK library which
      computes the Voronoi diagram.  The program then takes one
      "snapshot" of the diagram, which is written to an
      EPS image file, and stores the vertex and line information defines
      the Voronoi triangulation as XYZ and XYZF files.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay 
      triangulation of points on a sphere by computing their convex hull.  
      If the sphere is the unit sphere at the origin, the facet normals are 
      the Voronoi vertices.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote><code>
        <b>sphere_voronoi</b> <i>file.xyz</i>
      </code></blockquote>
      reads the XYZ file <i>file.xyz</i> containing the point coordinates,
      creates an EPS file <i>file.eps</i> containing a 2D projection of the Voronoi
      diagram, and creates an XYZ file <i>file.voronoi.xyz</i> and an XYZF file
      <i>file.xyzf</i> which can be used, in conjunction with <i>file_voronoi.xyz</i>
      to display the 3D Voronoi diagram.
