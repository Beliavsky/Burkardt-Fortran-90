      <b>HERMITE_CUBIC</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      computes the value, derivatives or integral of a 
      hermite cubic polynomial, or manipulates an interpolating function 
      made up of piecewise Hermite cubic polynomials.

      The Hermite Cubic
    </h3>

    <p>
      The Hermite form of a cubic polynomial defines the polynomial <b>p(x)</b>
      by specifying two distinct points <b>x1</b> and <b>x2</b>, and
      providing values for the following four items:
      <pre>
        f1 = p(x1)
        d1 = p'(x1)
        f2 = p(x2)
        d2 = p'(x2)
      </pre>
      The locations of the abscissas and the four data values are enough
      to uniquely define a cubic polynomial, known as the Hermite cubic.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the Hermite cubic representation, it is possible to determine
      the standard power series form:
      <pre>
        p(x) = c<sub>0</sub> + c<sub>1</sub> * x + c<sub>2</sub> * x<sup>2</sup> + c<sub>3</sub> * x<sup>3</sup>
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible, given any value of the argument <b>x</b> and the
      data values that define the Hermite cubic polynomial, to determine the
      value of <b>p(x)</b>, as well as the values of the first, second and third
      derivatives.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible, given two values of the argument <b>x3</b> and
      <b>x4</b>, and the data values that define the Hermite cubic polynomial,
      to determine the value of the integral of <b>p(x)</b> over the interval
      [x3,x4].
    </p>

      Hermite Cubic Splines:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A sequence of Hermite cubic polynomials can be used to produce a
      piecewise cubic Hermite interpolant, if we are given a strictly
      increasing sequence of <b>n</b> nodes <b>x(1:n)</b>, and corresponding
      data vectors <b>f(1:n)</b> and <b>d(1:n)</b>.  This is done by
      defining <b>n-1</b> cubic Hermite polynomials, with the <b>i</b>-th
      polynomial defined using the data at nodes <b>x(i)</b> and <b>x(i+1)</b>.
      The resulting function interpolates the value and derivative data,
      and is continuous and continuously differentiable everywhere,
      and in particular, at the nodes.
