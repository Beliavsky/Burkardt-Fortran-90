SPHERE_CVT
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  A sample problem for the probabilistic
  Spherical Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm.
 
  Given a unit sphere in 3D, the problem is to determine
  a set of GENERATORS, that is, a set of points which 
  lie on the sphere, and which implicitly define a
  division of the surface into Voronoi cells.
  It is also desired that each generator point actually
  be the centroid of its cell.
