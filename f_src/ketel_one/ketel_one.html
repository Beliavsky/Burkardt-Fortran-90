    <p>
      <b>ketel_one</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      seeks all words that can be formed from the letters in "ketel one vodka".
    </p>

    <p>
      The following challenge appeared in an advertistement in 
      the New York Times, 14 June 2007:
      <blockquote><i>
        "Dear Ketel One Drinker: Can you make one hundred words, of four letters
        or more, from the letters in Ketel One Vodka?"
      </i></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      The letters cannot appear in a new word more often than they
      appear in the original phrase.  So "leek" is OK (there are 3 e's 
      available), but "noon" is not (there is only one n).
