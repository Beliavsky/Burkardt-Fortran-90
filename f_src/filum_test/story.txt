A LOATHSOME COMPANION

This is the story of a muddy little boy named Wart,
who never would wash, and had no shoes, and walked
around town crying "What, what?".  (This happened
back in 1923!)

One day, Wart discovered a board with a gruesome
nail lying in the middle of the road.  He seized the
board as though it were a treasure, and carried it
home, resting on his shoulder.

Not long after Wart discovered his weapon, Mrs
Grundy's butler was standing on the stoop, beating
a carpet and coughing from the clouds of dust.

"What, what?" cried Wart.

"What's that you've got there?", replied the butler.
