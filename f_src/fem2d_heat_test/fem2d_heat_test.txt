FEM2D_HEAT
  FORTRAN90 version:
  Solution of the time dependent heat equation
  on an arbitrary triangulated region D in 2 dimensions.
 
  Ut - Uxx - Uyy + K(x,y,t) * U = F(x,y,t) in D;
                              U = G(x,y,t) on boundary;
                              U = H(x,y,t) at initial time.
 
  The finite element method is used, with
  6 node quadratic triangular elements ("T6").
 
  The time derivative is approximated using the
  backward Euler formula.
 
  Current status:
 
  * Time step information currently set internally!
  * Would be easy to do linear triangles as well.
  * Do you want ability to compare to an exact solution?
