      LATTICE_RULE <br> Lattice Rules for Multiple Integration
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LATTICE_RULE</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      approximates integrals in multiple 
      dimensions using lattice rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lattice rules are defined on the unit square, or in higher
      dimensions, on the unit hypercube.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Lattice rules are more suitable to integrands that are periodic, 
      with period 1, in all variables.  However, there are techniques 
      that may be used when the integrand does not satisfy this requirement.
    </p>

    <p>
      The performance of a lattice rule depends heavily on the choice
      of the generator vectors.  Once the spatial dimension and the
      number of points have been chosen, there are techniques for 
      finding a good generator vector.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest lattice rules are called "rank 1" rules, and
      use a lattice generated by multiples of a single generator vector.
      More elaborate rules can be generated by using more generator vectors,
      up to the maximum, which is the dimension of the space.
