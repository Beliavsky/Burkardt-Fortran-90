      PPPACK <br> Piecewise Polynomial Package
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PPPACK</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      evaluates piecewise polynomial functions, including cubic splines.
      The original FORTRAN77 library is by Carl de Boor.
    </p>

    <p>
      An original, true, correct version of PPPACK is available at
              <a href = "http://www.netlib.org/pppack/index.html">

      Files shown here are modifications made in pursuance of my
      own interests and needs, and should not be considered in preference
      to the original versions.

      Piecewise Polynomial Functions:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Typically, a set of data ( X(I), Y(I) ) for I=1, L+1 is available
      which is to be interpolated.  A function F(X) is to be found which
      passes through the given data.  F(X) is to be constructed from
      some order of polynomials, often cubic, and is to be continuously
      differentiable to all orders except at certain 'break' points,
      most likely at the same X points given with the data.  Thus, to
      determine the types of functions F we can construct, it is necessary
      to specify the number of break points L+1, or intervals L, the
      location of the breakpoints 'BREAK', the values that the function is
      to assume at the breakpoints 'Y' or some other condition,
      and the order 'K' of the polynomial pieces.  Sometimes auxilliary
      information, such as the slope or second derivative of the
      function at the left and right endpoints is part of the
      prescription.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a set of interpolating conditions or other requirements,
      the piecewise polynomial routines that follow will produce or
      manipulate a representation of the function F which has the form:
      <pre><b>
        ( BREAK, PCOEF, K, L )
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      These quantities represent the function F in the following way.
      If a point X is between breakpoints BREAK(I) and BREAK(I+1),
      then set
      <pre><b>
        H = X - BREAK(I),
      </b></pre>
      and we have
      <pre><b>
        F(X)= PCOEF(1,I)
             + PCOEF(2,I) * H
             + PCOEF(3,I) * H^2 / 2!
             + PCOEF(4,I) * H^3 / 3!
             ...
             + PCOEF(K,I) * H^(K-1) /(K-1)!
      </b></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the piecewise polynomial functions make F and
      its derivatives continuous from the right.  Thus at
      the break point I+1, we use the definition of F appropriate
      for the interval ( BREAK(I+1), BREAK(I+2) ) and not
      ( BREAK(I), BREAK(I+1) ).
    </p>

    <p>
      Note also that the behavior of the function F for X values
      below the first breakpoint BREAK(1) or above the last breakpoint
      BREAK(L+1) is not specified.  In fact, generally, F is set to zero
      below BREAK(1), and the definition of F on the last interval
      ( BREAK(L), BREAK(L+1) ) is extended all the way to the right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever you have a piecewise polynomial representation of the
      above form, you can evaluate the function F(X) by calling
      the function PPVALU.  Moreover, other routines like BSPLPP
      can convert a B-spline representation into a piecewise polynomial
      representation.  Also, KNOTS can use the information
      in the breakpoint sequence BREAK, with the continuity conditions
      required, to construct an equivalent knot sequence for a B-spline.
