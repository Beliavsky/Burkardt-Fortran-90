    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>PWL_INTERP_2D_SCATTERED</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      produces a piecewise linear interpolant to 2D scattered data,
      that is, data that is not guaranteed to lie on a regular grid.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program computes a Delaunay triangulation of the data points,
      and then constructs an interpolant triangle by triangle.  Over a given
      triangle, the interpolant is the linear function which matches the
      data already given at the vertices of the triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      PWL_INTERP_2D requires the R8LIB library.  The test code
      requires the TEST_INTERP_2D library.
