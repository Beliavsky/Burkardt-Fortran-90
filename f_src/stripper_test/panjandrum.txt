So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage
leaf, to make an apple pie; and at the same time a 
great she-bear coming up the street, pops its head 
into the shop. "What! no soap?"  So he died, and

were present the Picninnies, and the Joblillies, and 
the Garyulies, and the grand Panjandrum himself, 
with the little round button at top; and they all 
fell to playing the game of catch as catch can, 
till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their 
boots.
