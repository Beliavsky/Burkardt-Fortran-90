SO SHE WENT INTO THE GARDEN TO CUT A CABBAGE
LEAF, TO MAKE AN APPLE PIE; AND AT THE SAME TIME A
GREAT SHE-BEAR COMING UP THE STREET, POPS ITS HEAD
INTO THE SHOP. "WHAT! NO SOAP?"  SO HE DIED, AND
SHE VERY IMPRUDENTLY MARRIED THE BARBER; AND THERE
WERE PRESENT THE PICNINNIES, AND THE JOBLILLIES, AND
THE GARYULIES, AND THE GRAND PANJANDRUM HIMSELF,
WITH THE LITTLE ROUND BUTTON AT TOP; AND THEY ALL
FELL TO PLAYING THE GAME OF CATCH AS CATCH CAN,
TILL THE GUNPOWDER RAN OUT AT THE HEELS OF THEIR
BOOTS.
