      RBF_INTERP_2D <br> Radial Basis Function Interpolation in 2D
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>RBF_INTERP_2D</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines and evaluates radial basis function (RBF) interpolants to 2D data.
    </p>

    <p>
      A radial basis interpolant is a useful, but expensive, technique for 
      definining a smooth function which interpolates a set of function values
      specified at an arbitrary set of data points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given nd multidimensional points xd with function values fd, and a 
      basis function phi(r), the form of the interpolant is
      <pre>
       f(x) = sum ( 1 <= i <= nd ) w(i) * phi(||x-xd(i)||)
      </pre>
      where the weights w have been precomputed by solving
      <pre>
        sum ( 1 <= i <= nd ) w(i) * phi(||xd(j)-xd(i)||) = fd(j)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the technique is generally applied in a multidimensional setting,
      in this directory we look specifically at the case involving 
      2D data.  This allows us to easily plot and compare the various
      results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Four families of radial basis functions are provided. 
      <ul>
        <li>
          phi1(r) = sqrt ( r^2 + r0^2 ) (multiquadric)
        </li>
        <li>
          phi2(r) = 1 / sqrt ( r^2 + r0^2 ) (inverse multiquadric)
        </li>
        <li>
          phi3(r) = r^2 * log ( r / r0 )   (thin plate spline)
        </li>
        <li>
          phi4(r) = exp ( -0.5 r^2 / r0^2 )   (gaussian)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Each uses a 
      "scale factor" r0, whose value is recommended to be greater than
      the minimal distance between points, and rather less than the maximal distance.
      Changing the value of r0 changes the shape of the interpolant function.

      RBF_INTERP_2D needs access to the R8LIB library.  The test program
      also needs access to the TEST_INTERP_2D library.
