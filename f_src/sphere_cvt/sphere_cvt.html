    <p>
      <b>SPHERE_CVT</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      seeks to determine N well-separated sites on the unit sphere in 3D,
      using centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code assumes that good separation will follow automatically
      if the points are the centroids of their Voronoi regions.
      Thus, the code actually places N points at random on the sphere,
      and then applies probabilistic centroidal Voronoi tessellation
      techniques in an attempt to force the the CVT condition to be satisfied.
      The output of the program is an
      <a href = "../../data/xyz/xyz.html">XYZ file</a> 
      containing the coordinates of the points.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay 
      triangulation of points on a sphere by computing their convex hull.  
      If the sphere is the unit sphere at the origin, the facet normals are 
      the Voronoi vertices.
